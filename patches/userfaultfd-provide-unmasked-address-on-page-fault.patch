Subject: userfaultfd: provide unmasked address on page-fault

Userfaultfd is supposed to provide the full address (i.e., unmasked) of
the faulting access back to userspace.  However, that is not the case for
quite some time.

Even running "userfaultfd_demo" from the userfaultfd man page provides the
wrong output (and contradicts the man page).  Notice that
"UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT event" shows the masked address (7fc5e30b3000) and
not the first read address (0x7fc5e30b300f).

	Address returned by mmap() = 0x7fc5e30b3000

	fault_handler_thread():
	    poll() returns: nready = 1; POLLIN = 1; POLLERR = 0
	    UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT event: flags = 0; address = 7fc5e30b3000
		(uffdio_copy.copy returned 4096)
	Read address 0x7fc5e30b300f in main(): A
	Read address 0x7fc5e30b340f in main(): A
	Read address 0x7fc5e30b380f in main(): A
	Read address 0x7fc5e30b3c0f in main(): A

The exact address is useful for various reasons and specifically for
prefetching decisions.  If it is known that the memory is populated by
certain objects whose size is not page-aligned, then based on the faulting
address, the uffd-monitor can decide whether to prefetch and prefault the
adjacent page.

This bug has been for quite some time in the kernel: since commit
1a29d85eb0f1 ("mm: use vmf->address instead of of vmf->virtual_address")
vmf->virtual_address"), which dates back to 2016.  A concern has been
raised that existing userspace application might rely on the old/wrong
behavior in which the address is masked.  Therefore, it was suggested to
provide the masked address unless the user explicitly asks for the exact
address.

Add a new userfaultfd feature UFFD_FEATURE_EXACT_ADDRESS to direct
userfaultfd to provide the exact address.  Add a new "real_address" field
to vmf to hold the unmasked address.  Provide the address to userspace
accordingly.

Initialize real_address in various code-paths to be consistent with
address, even when it is not used, to be on the safe side.
