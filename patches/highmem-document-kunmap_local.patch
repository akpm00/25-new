Subject: highmem: document kunmap_local()

Some users of kmap() add an offset to the kmap() address to be used
during the mapping.

When converting to kmap_local_page() the base address does not
need to be stored because any address within the page can be used in
kunmap_local().  However, this was not clear from the documentation and
cause some questions.[1]

Document that any address in the page can be used in kunmap_local() to
clarify this for future users.
