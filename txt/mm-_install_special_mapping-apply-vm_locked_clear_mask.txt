Subject: mm: _install_special_mapping() apply VM_LOCKED_CLEAR_MASK

_install_special_mapping() adds the VM_SPECIAL bit VM_DONTEXPAND (and
never attempts to update locked_vm), so it ought to be consistent with
mmap_region() and mlock_fixup(), making sure not to add VM_LOCKED or
VM_LOCKONFAULT.  I doubt that this fixes any problem in practice: just do
it for consistency.
