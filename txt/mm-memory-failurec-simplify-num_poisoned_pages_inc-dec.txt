Subject: mm/memory-failure.c: simplify num_poisoned_pages_inc/dec

Originally, do num_poisoned_pages_inc() in memory failure routine, use
num_poisoned_pages_dec() to rollback the number if filtered/ cancelled.

Suggested by Naoya, do num_poisoned_pages_inc() only in action_result(),
this make this clear and simple.
