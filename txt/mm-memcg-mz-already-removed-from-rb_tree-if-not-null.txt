Subject: mm/memcg: mz already removed from rb_tree if not NULL

When mz is not NULL, it means mz can either come from
mem_cgroup_largest_soft_limit_node or
__mem_cgroup_largest_soft_limit_node.  And both of them have removed this
node by __mem_cgroup_remove_exceeded().

Not necessary to call __mem_cgroup_remove_exceeded() again.
