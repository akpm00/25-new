Subject: Docs/vm/damon: call low level monitoring primitives the operations

Patch series "Docs/damon: Update documents for better consistency".

Some of DAMON document are not properly updated for latest version.  This
patchset updates such parts.


This patch (of 3):

DAMON code calls the low level monitoring primitives implementations the
monitoring operations.  The documentation would have no problem at still
calling those primitives implementation because there is no real
difference in the concepts, but making it more consistent with the code
would make it better.  This commit therefore convert sentences in the doc
specifically pointing the implementations of the primitives to call it
monitoring operations.
