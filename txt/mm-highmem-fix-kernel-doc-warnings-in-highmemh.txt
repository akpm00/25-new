Subject: mm/highmem: fix kernel-doc warnings in highmem*.h

Patch series "Extend and reorganize Highmem's documentation".

This series has the purpose to extend and reorganize Highmem's
documentation.

This is still a work in progress, because some information should still be
moved from highmem.rst to highmem.h and highmem-internal.h.  Specifically
I'm talking about moving the "how to" information to the relevant headers,
as it as been suggested by Ira Weiny (Intel).


This patch (of 4):

`scripts/kernel-doc -v -none include/linux/highmem*` reports the following
warnings:

include/linux/highmem.h:160: warning: expecting prototype for kunmap_atomic(). Prototype was for nr_free_highpages() instead
include/linux/highmem.h:204: warning: No description found for return value of 'alloc_zeroed_user_highpage_movable'
include/linux/highmem-internal.h:256: warning: Function parameter or member '__addr' not described in 'kunmap_atomic'
include/linux/highmem-internal.h:256: warning: Excess function parameter 'addr' description in 'kunmap_atomic'

Fix these warnings by (1) moving the kernel-doc comments from highmem.h to
highmem-internal.h (which is the file were the kunmap_atomic() macro is
actually defined), (2) extending and merging it with the comment which was
already in highmem-internal.h, and (3) using correct parameter names.
