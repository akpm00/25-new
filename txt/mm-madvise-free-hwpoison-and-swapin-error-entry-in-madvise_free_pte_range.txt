Subject: mm/madvise: free hwpoison and swapin error entry in madvise_free_pte_range

Once the MADV_FREE operation has succeeded, callers can expect they might
get zero-fill pages if accessing the memory again.  Therefore it should be
safe to delete the hwpoison entry and swapin error entry.  There is no
reason to kill the process if it has called MADV_FREE on the range.
