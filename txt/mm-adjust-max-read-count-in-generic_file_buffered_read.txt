Subject: mm: adjust max read count in generic_file_buffered_read()

When we try to truncate read count in generic_file_buffered_read(), should
deliver (sb->s_maxbytes - offset) as maximum count not sb->s_maxbytes
itself.

Userspace effects?  Jan said

: I think ->readpage() could be called for index beyond maximum file size
: supported by the filesystem leading to weird filesystem behavior due to
: overflows in internal calculations.
