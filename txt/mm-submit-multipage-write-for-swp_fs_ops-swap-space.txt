Subject: mm: submit multipage write for SWP_FS_OPS swap-space

swap_writepage() is given one page at a time, but may be called repeatedly
in succession.

For block-device swapspace, the blk_plug functionality allows the multiple
pages to be combined together at lower layers.  That cannot be used for
SWP_FS_OPS as blk_plug may not exist - it is only active when
CONFIG_BLOCK=y.  Consequently all swap reads over NFS are single page
reads.

With this patch we pass a pointer-to-pointer via the wbc.  swap_writepage
can store state between calls - much like the pointer passed explicitly to
swap_readpage.  After calling swap_writepage() some number of times, the
state will be passed to swap_write_unplug() which can submit the combined
request.
