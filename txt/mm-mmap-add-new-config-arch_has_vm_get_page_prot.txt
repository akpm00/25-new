Subject: mm/mmap: add new config ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT

Patch series "mm/mmap: Drop arch_vm_get_page_prot() and arch_filter_pgprot()", v4.

protection_map[] is an array based construct that translates given
vm_flags combination.  This array contains page protection map, which is
populated by the platform via [__S000 ..  __S111] and [__P000 ..  __P111]
exported macros.  Primary usage for protection_map[] is for
vm_get_page_prot(), which is used to determine page protection value for a
given vm_flags.  vm_get_page_prot() implementation, could again call
platform overrides arch_vm_get_page_prot() and arch_filter_pgprot().  Some
platforms override protection_map[] that was originally built with
__SXXX/__PXXX with different runtime values.

Currently there are multiple layers of abstraction i.e __SXXX/__PXXX
macros, protection_map[], arch_vm_get_page_prot() and arch_filter_pgprot()
built between the platform and generic MM, finally defining
vm_get_page_prot().

Hence this series proposes to drop later two abstraction levels and
instead just move the responsibility of defining vm_get_page_prot() to the
platform (still utilizing generic protection_map[] array) itself making it
clean and simple.

This first introduces ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT which enables the
platforms to define custom vm_get_page_prot().  This starts converting
platforms that define the overrides arch_filter_pgprot() or
arch_vm_get_page_prot() which enables for those constructs to be dropped
off completely.

The series has been inspired from an earlier discuss with Christoph Hellwig

This patch (of 7):

Add a new config ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT, which when subscribed enables
a given platform to define its own vm_get_page_prot() but still utilizing
the generic protection_map[] array.
