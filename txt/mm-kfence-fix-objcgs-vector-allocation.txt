Subject: mm: kfence: fix objcgs vector allocation

If the kfence object is allocated to be used for objects vector, then this
slot of the pool eventually being occupied permanently since the vector is
never freed.  The solutions could be 1) freeing vector when the kfence
object is freed or 2) allocating all vectors statically.  Since the memory
consumption of object vectors is low, it is better to chose 2) to fix the
issue and it is also can reduce overhead of vectors allocating in the
future.
