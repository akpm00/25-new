Subject: lib/string_helpers: fix not adding strarray to device's resource list

Add allocated strarray to device's resource list. This is a must to
automatically release strarray when the device disappears.

Without this fix we have a memory leak in the few drivers which use
devm_kasprintf_strarray().
