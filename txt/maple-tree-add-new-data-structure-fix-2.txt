Subject: maple_tree: Fix potential insufficient nodes on mas_spanning_rebalance()

When a spanning store occurs at a non-root node but causes an insufficient
leave, mas_spanning_rebalance() was not detecting it as a non-root node. 
This only happened when the spanning write was detected at the root node.
