Subject: maple_tree: fix mas_next() when already on the last node entry
Date: Tue, 17 May 2022 14:59:22 +0000

It is possible to return the metadata as the next entry if the last node
entry is already in the maple state and the limit is not reached.  Check
for this condition in mas_next_nentry() where the node end is returned.
