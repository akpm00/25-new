From: Miaohe Lin <linmiaohe@huawei.com> Subject: mm/swapfile: fix lost
swap bits in unuse_pte()

This is observed by code review only but not any real report.

When we turn off swapping we could have lost the bits stored in the swap
ptes.  The new rmap-exclusive bit is fine since that turned into a page
flag, but not for soft-dirty and uffd-wp.  Add them.
