Subject: mm/smaps_rollup: return empty file for kthreads instead of ESRCH

This restores the behavior prior to 258f669e7e88 ("mm:
/proc/pid/smaps_rollup: convert to single value seq_file"), making it once
again consistent with maps and smaps, and allowing patterns like awk
'$1=="Anonymous:"{x+=$2}END{print x}' /proc/*/smaps_rollup to work. 
Searching all Debian packages for "smaps_rollup" did not find any programs
which would be affected by this change.
