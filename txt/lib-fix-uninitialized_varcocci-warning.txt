Subject: lib/glob.c: fix uninitialized_var.cocci warning

Fix the following coccicheck warning:
lib/glob.c:48:40-41: WARNING this kind of initialization is deprecated.

`char const *back_str = back_str` has the same form of uninitialized_var()
macro.  I remove the redundant assignement.  It has been tested with gcc
(Debian 8.3.0-6) 8.3.0.

The patch which removed uninitialized_var() is:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20121028102007.GA7547@gmail.com/
And there are very few "/* GCC */" comments in the Linux kernel code now.
