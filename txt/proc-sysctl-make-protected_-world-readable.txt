Subject: proc/sysctl: make protected_* world readable

protected_* files have 600 permissions which prevents non-superuser from
reading them.

Container like "AWS greengrass" refuse to launch unless
protected_hardlinks and protected_symlinks are set.  When containers like
these run with "userns-remap" or "--user" mapping container's root to
non-superuser on host, they fail to run due to denied read access to these
files.

As these protections are hardly a secret, and do not possess any security
risk, making them world readable.

Though above greengrass usecase needs read access to only
protected_hardlinks and protected_symlinks files, setting all other
protected_* files to 644 to keep consistency.
