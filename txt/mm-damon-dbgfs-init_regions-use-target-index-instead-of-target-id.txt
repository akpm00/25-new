Subject: mm/damon/dbgfs/init_regions: use target index instead of target id

Patch series "Remove the type-unclear target id concept".

DAMON asks each monitoring target ('struct damon_target') to have one
'unsigned long' integer called 'id', which should be unique among the
targets of same monitoring context.  Meaning of it is, however, totally up
to the monitoring primitives that registered to the monitoring context. 
For example, the virtual address spaces monitoring primitives treats the
id as a 'struct pid' pointer.

This makes the code flexible but ugly, not well-documented, and
type-unsafe[1].  Also, identification of each target can be done via its
index.  For the reason, this patchset removes the concept and uses clear
type definition.

This patch (of 4):

Target id is a 'unsigned long' data, which can be interpreted differently
by each monitoring primitives.  For example, it means 'struct pid *' for
the virtual address spaces monitoring, while it means nothing but an
integer to be displayed to debugfs interface users for the physical
address space monitoring.  It's flexible but makes code ugly and
type-unsafe[1].

To be prepared for eventual removal of the concept, this commit removes a
use case of the concept in 'init_regions' debugfs file handling.  In
detail, this commit replaces use of the id with the index of each target
in the context's targets list.
