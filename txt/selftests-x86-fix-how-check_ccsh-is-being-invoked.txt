Subject: selftests, x86: fix how check_cc.sh is being invoked

The $(CC) variable used in Makefiles could contain several arguments such
as "ccache gcc".  These need to be passed as a single string to
check_cc.sh, otherwise only the first argument will be used as the
compiler command.  Without quotes, the $(CC) variable is passed as
distinct arguments which causes the script to fail to build trivial
programs.

Fix this by adding quotes around $(CC) when calling check_cc.sh to pass
the whole string as a single argument to the script even if it has several
words such as "ccache gcc".
