Subject: mm/memcontrol: export memcg->watermark via sysfs for v2 memcg

We run a lot of automated tests when building our software and run into
OOM scenarios when the tests run unbounded.  v1 memcg exports
memcg->watermark as "memory.max_usage_in_bytes" in sysfs.  We use this
metric to heuristically limit the number of tests that can run in parallel
based on per test historical data.

This metric is currently not exported for v2 memcg and there is no other
easy way of getting this information.  getrusage() syscall returns
"ru_maxrss" which can be used as an approximation but that's the max RSS
of a single child process across all children instead of the aggregated
max for all child processes.  The only work around is to periodically poll
"memory.current" but that's not practical for short-lived one-off cgroups.

Hence, expose memcg->watermark as "memory.peak" for v2 memcg.
