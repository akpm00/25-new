Subject: mm: compaction: make sure highest is above the min_pfn

It's not guaranteed that highest will be above the min_pfn.  If highest is
below the min_pfn, migrate_pfn and free_pfn can meet prematurely and lead
to some useless work.  Make sure highest is above min_pfn to avoid making
a futile effort.
