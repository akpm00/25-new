Subject: mm: fix is_pinnable_page against on cma page

Pages on CMA area could have MIGRATE_ISOLATE as well as MIGRATE_CMA so
current is_pinnable_page could miss CMA pages which has MIGRATE_ ISOLATE. 
It ends up pinning CMA pages as longterm at pin_user_pages APIs so CMA
allocation keep failed until the pin is released.

page migration failure with pinned page
                                        ..
                                        .. After 30 sec
                                        unpin_user_page(page)

CMA allocation succeeded after 30 sec.

The CMA allocation path protects the migration type change race using
zone->lock but what GUP path need to know is just whether the page is on
CMA area or not rather than exact migration type.  Thus, we don't need
zone->lock but just checks migration type in either of (MIGRATE_ISOLATE
and MIGRATE_CMA).

Adding the MIGRATE_ISOLATE check in is_pinnable_page could cause rejecting
of pinning pages on MIGRATE_ISOLATE pageblocks even though it's neither
CMA nor movable zone if the page is temporarily unmovable.  However, such
a migration failure by unexpected temporal refcount holding is general
issue, not only come from MIGRATE_ISOLATE and the MIGRATE_ISOLATE is also
transient state like other temporal elevated refcount problem.

[akpm@linux-foundation.org: MIGRATE_CMA and MIGRATE_ISOLATE are not bitwise, per Minchan]
[minchan@kernel.org: restore __mt definition]
[minchan@kernel.org: changes per Paul and John]
