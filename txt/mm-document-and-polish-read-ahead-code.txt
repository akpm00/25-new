Subject: mm: document and polish read-ahead code

Add some "big-picture" documentation for read-ahead and polish the code to
make it fit this documentation.

The meaning of ->async_size is clarified to match its name.  i.e.  Any
request to ->readahead() has a sync part and an async part.  The caller
will wait for the sync pages to complete, but will not wait for the async
pages.  The first async page is still marked PG_readahead

Note that the current function names page_cache_sync_ra() and
page_cache_async_ra() are misleading.  All ra request are partly sync and
partly async, so either part can be empty.  A page_cache_sync_ra() request
will usually set ->async_size non-zero, implying it is not all
synchronous.

When a non-zero req_count is passed to page_cache_async_ra(), the
implication is that some prefix of the request is synchronous, though the
calculation made there is incorrect - I haven't tried to fix it.
