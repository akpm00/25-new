Subject: mm: allow can_split_folio() to be called when THP are disabled

The call to can_split_folio() in vmscan is currently guarded by a test of
PageTransHuge() so the BUILD_BUG() is eliminated if THP are disabled.  The
next patch replaces that test with folio_test_large() which may be true,
even when THP are disabled.  However, if THP are disabled, we cannot
split, so an unconditional return of false is appropriate.
