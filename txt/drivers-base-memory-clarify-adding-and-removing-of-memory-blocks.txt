Subject: drivers/base/memory: clarify adding and removing of memory blocks

Let's make it clearer at which places we actually add and remove memory
blocks -- streamlining the terminology -- and highlight which memory block
start out online and which start out as offline.

* rename add_memory_block -> add_boot_memory_block
* rename init_memory_block -> add_memory_block
* rename unregister_memory -> remove_memory_block
* rename register_memory -> __add_memory_block
* add add_hotplug_memory_block
* mark add_boot_memory_block with __init (suggested by Oscar)

__add_memory_block() is  a pure helper for add_memory_block(), remove
the somewhat obvious comment.
