Subject: Revert "mm: madvise: skip unmapped vma holes passed to process_madvise"

This reverts commit 08095d6310a7 ("mm: madvise: skip unmapped vma holes
passed to process_madvise") as process_madvise() fails to return the exact
processed bytes in other cases too.  As an example: if process_madvise()
hits mlocked pages after processing some initial bytes passed in [start,
end), it just returns EINVAL although some bytes are processed.  Thus
making an exception only for ENOMEM is partially fixing the problem of
returning the proper advised bytes.

Thus revert this patch and return proper bytes advised.
