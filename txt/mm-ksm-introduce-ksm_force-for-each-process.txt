Subject: mm/ksm: introduce ksm_force for each process

From: xu xin <xu.xin16@zte.com.cn>

To use KSM, we have to explicitly call madvise() in application code,
which means installed apps on OS needs to be uninstall and source code
needs to be modified. It is inconvenient.

In order to change this situation, We add a new proc file ksm_force
under /proc/<pid>/ to support turning on/off KSM scanning of a
process's mm dynamically.

If ksm_force is set to 1, force all anonymous and 'qualified' VMAs
of this mm to be involved in KSM scanning without explicitly calling
madvise to mark VMA as MADV_MERGEABLE. But It is effective only when
the klob of /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run is set as 1.

If ksm_force is set to 0, cancel the feature of ksm_force of this
process and unmerge those merged pages belonging to VMAs which is not
madvised as MADV_MERGEABLE of this process, but leave MADV_MERGEABLE
areas merged.
