Subject: tools/vm/page_owner_sort.c: support sorting pid and time

When viewing the page owner information, we expect that the information
can be sorted by PID, so that we can quickly combine PID with the program
to check the information together.

We also expect that the information can be sorted by time.  Time sorting
helps to view the running status of the program according to the time
interval when the program hangs up.

Finally, we hope to pass the page_ owner_ Sort.  C can reduce part of the
output and only output the plate information whose memory has not been
released, which can make us locate the problem of the program faster. 
Therefore, the following adjustments have been made:

1. Add the static functions search_pattern and check_regcomp to
   improve the cleanliness.

2. Add member attributes and their corresponding sorting methods.  In
   terms of comparison time, int will overflow because the data of ull is
   too large, so the ternary operator is used

3. Add the -f parameter to filter out the information of blocks whose
   memory has not been released
