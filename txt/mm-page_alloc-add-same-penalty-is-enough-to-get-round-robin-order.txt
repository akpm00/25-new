Subject: mm/page_alloc: adding same penalty is enough to get round-robin order

To make node order in round-robin in the same distance group, we add a
penalty to the first node we got in each round.

To get a round-robin order in the same distance group, we don't need to
decrease the penalty since:

  * find_next_best_node() always iterates node in the same order
  * distance matters more then penalty in find_next_best_node()
  * in nodes with the same distance, the first one would be picked up

So it is fine to increase same penalty when we get the first node in the
same distance group.  Since we just increase a constance of 1 to node
penalty, it is not necessary to multiply MAX_NODE_LOAD for preference.
