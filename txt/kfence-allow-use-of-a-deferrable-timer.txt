Subject: kfence: allow use of a deferrable timer

Allow the use of a deferrable timer, which does not force CPU wake-ups
when the system is idle.  A consequence is that the sample interval
becomes very unpredictable, to the point that it is not guaranteed that
the KFENCE KUnit test still passes.

Nevertheless, on power-constrained systems this may be preferable, so
let's give the user the option should they accept the above trade-off.
