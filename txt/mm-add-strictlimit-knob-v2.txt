Subject: mm: add strictlimit knob

The "strictlimit" feature was introduced to enforce per-bdi dirty limits
for FUSE which sets bdi max_ratio to 1% by default:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mm/105809

However the feature can be useful for other relatively slow or untrusted
BDIs like USB flash drives and DVD+RW.  The patch adds a knob to enable
the feature:

echo 1 > /sys/class/bdi/X:Y/strictlimit

Being enabled, the feature enforces bdi max_ratio limit even if global
(10%) dirty limit is not reached.  Of course, the effect is not visible
until /sys/class/bdi/X:Y/max_ratio is decreased to some reasonable value.

: desktop automounters usually mount USB devices with 'sync' mount option).
