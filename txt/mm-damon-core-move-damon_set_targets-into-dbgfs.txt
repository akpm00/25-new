Subject: mm/damon/core: move damon_set_targets() into dbgfs

damon_set_targets() function is defined in the core for general use cases,
but called from only dbgfs.  Also, because the function is for general use
cases, dbgfs does additional handling of pid type target id case.  To make
the situation simpler, this commit moves the function into dbgfs and makes
it to do the pid type case handling on its own.
