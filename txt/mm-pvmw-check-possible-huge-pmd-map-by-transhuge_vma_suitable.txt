Subject: mm: pvmw: check possible huge PMD map by transhuge_vma_suitable()
Date: Fri, 13 May 2022 12:17:05 -0700

IIUC PVMW checks if the vma is possibly huge PMD mapped by
transparent_hugepage_active() and "pvmw->nr_pages >= HPAGE_PMD_NR".

Actually pvmw->nr_pages is returned by compound_nr() or
folio_nr_pages(), so the page should be THP as long as "pvmw->nr_pages
>= HPAGE_PMD_NR".  And it is guaranteed THP is allocated for valid VMA
in the first place.  But it may be not PMD mapped if the VMA is file
VMA and it is not properly aligned.  The transhuge_vma_suitable()
is used to do such check, so replace transparent_hugepage_active() to
it, which is too heavy and overkilling.
