Subject: mm/page_owner: record task command name

The page_owner information currently includes the pid of the calling task.
That is useful as long as the task is still running.  Otherwise, the
number is meaningless.  To have more information about the allocating
tasks that had exited by the time the page_owner information is retrieved,
we need to store the command name of the task.

Add a new comm field into page_owner structure to store the command name
and display it when the page_owner information is retrieved.
