Subject: linux/kthread.h: remove unused macros

Ever since these macros were introduced in commit b56c0d8937e6 ("kthread:
implement kthread_worker"), there has been precisely one user (commit
4d115420707a, "NVMe: Async IO queue deletion"), and that user went away in
2016 with db3cbfff5bcc ("NVMe: IO queue deletion re-write").

Apart from being unused, these macros are also awkward to use (which may
contribute to them not being used): Having a way to statically (or
on-stack) allocating the storage for the struct kthread_worker itself
doesn't help much, since obviously one needs to have some code for
actually _spawning_ the worker thread, which must have error checking. 
And these days we have the kthread_create_worker() interface which both
allocates the struct kthread_worker and spawns the kthread.
