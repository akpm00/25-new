Subject: mm: start tracking VMAs with maple tree

Start tracking the VMAs with the new maple tree structure in parallel with
the rb_tree.  Add debug and trace events for maple tree operations and
duplicate the rb_tree that is created on forks into the maple tree.

The maple tree is added to the mm_struct including the mm_init struct,
added support in required mm/mmap functions, added tracking in kernel/fork
for process forking, and used to find the unmapped_area and checked
against what the rbtree finds.

This also moves the mmap_lock() in exit_mmap() since the oom reaper call
does walk the VMAs.  Otherwise lockdep will be unhappy if oom happens.
