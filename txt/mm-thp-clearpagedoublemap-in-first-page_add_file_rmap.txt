Subject: mm/thp: ClearPageDoubleMap in first page_add_file_rmap()

PageDoubleMap is maintained differently for anon and for shmem+file: the
shmem+file one was never cleared, because a safe place to do so could not
be found; so it would blight future use of the cached hugepage until
evicted.

See https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1571938066-29031-1-git-send-email-yang.shi@linux.alibaba.com/

But page_add_file_rmap() does provide a safe place to do so (though later
than one might wish): allowing testing to return to an initial state
without a damaging drop_caches.
