Subject: mm/hugetlb: take care of UFFDIO_COPY_MODE_WP

Pass the wp_copy variable into hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte() thoughout the
stack.  Apply the UFFD_WP bit if UFFDIO_COPY_MODE_WP is with UFFDIO_COPY.

Hugetlb pages are only managed by hugetlbfs, so we're safe even without
setting dirty bit in the huge pte if the page is installed as read-only. 
However we'd better still keep the dirty bit set for a read-only
UFFDIO_COPY pte (when UFFDIO_COPY_MODE_WP bit is set), not only to match
what we do with shmem, but also because the page does contain dirty data
that the kernel just copied from the userspace.
