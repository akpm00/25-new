Subject: mm/vmstat: add event for ksm swapping in copy

When faults in from swap what used to be a KSM page and that page had been
swapped in before, system has to make a copy, and leaves remerging the
pages to a later pass of ksmd.

That is not good for performace, we'd better to reduce this kind of copy. 
There are some ways to reduce it, for example lessen swappiness or
madvise(, , MADV_MERGEABLE) range.  So add this event to support doing
this tuning.  Just like this patch: "mm, THP, swap: add THP swapping out
fallback counting".
