Subject: mm: change zap_details.zap_mapping into even_cows

Currently we have a zap_mapping pointer maintained in zap_details, when it
is specified we only want to zap the pages that has the same mapping with
what the caller has specified.

But what we want to do is actually simpler: we want to skip zapping
private (COW-ed) pages in some cases.  We can refer to
unmap_mapping_pages() callers where we could have passed in different
even_cows values.  The other user is unmap_mapping_folio() where we always
want to skip private pages.

According to Hugh, we used a mapping pointer for historical reason, as
explained here:

Quoting partly from Hugh:

  Which raises the question again of why I did not just use a boolean flag
  there originally: aah, I think I've found why.  In those days there was a
  horrible "optimization", for better performance on some benchmark I guess,
  which when you read from /dev/zero into a private mapping, would map the zero
  page there (look up read_zero_pagealigned() and zeromap_page_range() if you
  dare).  So there was another category of page to be skipped along with the
  anon COWs, and I didn't want multiple tests in the zap loop, so checking
  check_mapping against page->mapping did both.  I think nowadays you could do
  it by checking for PageAnon page (or genuine swap entry) instead.

This patch replaces the zap_details.zap_mapping pointer into the even_cows
boolean, then we check it against PageAnon.
