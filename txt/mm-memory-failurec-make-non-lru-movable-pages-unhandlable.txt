Subject: mm/memory-failure.c: make non-LRU movable pages unhandlable

We can not really handle non-LRU movable pages in memory failure. 
Typically they are balloon, zsmalloc, etc.  Assuming we run into a base
(4K) non-LRU movable page, we could reach as far as identify_page_state(),
it should not fall into any category except me_unknown.

For the non-LRU compound movable pages, they could be taken for transhuge
pages but it's unexpected to split non-LRU movable pages using
split_huge_page_to_list in memory_failure.  So we could just simply make
non-LRU movable pages unhandlable to avoid these possible nasty cases.
