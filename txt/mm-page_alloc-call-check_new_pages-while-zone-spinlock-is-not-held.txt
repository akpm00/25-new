Subject: mm/page_alloc: call check_new_pages() while zone spinlock is not held

For high order pages not using pcp, rmqueue() is currently calling the
costly check_new_pages() while zone spinlock is held, and hard irqs
masked.

This is not needed, we can release the spinlock sooner to reduce zone
spinlock contention.

Note that after this patch, we call __mod_zone_freepage_state() before
deciding to leak the page because it is in bad state.
