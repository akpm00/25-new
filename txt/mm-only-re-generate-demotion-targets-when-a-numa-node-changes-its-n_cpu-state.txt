Subject: mm: only re-generate demotion targets when a numa node changes its N_CPU state

Abhishek reported that after patch [1], hotplug operations are taking
~double the expected time.  [2]

The reason behind is that the CPU callbacks that migrate_on_reclaim_init()
sets always call set_migration_target_nodes() whenever a CPU is brought
up/down.

But we only care about numa nodes going from having cpus to become
cpuless, and vice versa, as that influences the demotion_target order.

We do already have two CPU callbacks (vmstat_cpu_online() and
vmstat_cpu_dead()) that check exactly that, so get rid of the CPU
callbacks in migrate_on_reclaim_init() and only call
set_migration_target_nodes() from vmstat_cpu_{dead,online}() whenever a
numa node change its N_CPU state.
