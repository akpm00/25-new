Subject: mm: untangle config dependencies for demote-on-reclaim

At the time demote-on-reclaim was introduced, it was tied to
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU + CONFIG_MIGRATE, but that is not really accurate.

The only two things we need to depend on are CONFIG_NUMA + CONFIG_MIGRATE,
so clean this up.  Furthermore, we only register the hotplug memory
notifier when the system has CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG.
