Subject: init.h: improve __setup and early_param documentation

Igor noted in [1] that there are quite a few __setup() handling functions
that return incorrect values.  Doing this can be harmless, but it can also
cause strings to be added to init's argument or environment list,
polluting them.

Since __setup() handling and return values are not documented, first add
documentation for that.  Also add more documentation for early_param()
handling and return values.

For __setup() functions, returning 0 (not handled) has questionable
value if it is just a malformed option value, as in
  rodata=junk
since returning 0 would just cause "rodata=junk" to be added to init's
environment unnecessarily:
  Run /sbin/init as init process
    with arguments:
      /sbin/init
    with environment:
      HOME=/
      TERM=linux
      splash=native
      rodata=junk

Also, there are no recommendations on whether to print a warning when an
unknown parameter value is seen.  I am not addressing that here.
