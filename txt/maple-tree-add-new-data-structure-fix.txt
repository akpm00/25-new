Subject: maple_tree: Fix expanding null off the end of the data.

When expanding a write of null to another null, the metadata for the end
of the node may be off by one.  Fix this issue by setting the write end
pivot (wr_mas->end_piv) in mas_wr_extend_null().  Also use the saved value
for the end pivot during node stores instead of looking up the same entry
again.

There is also unnecessary code in mas_wr_extend_null() that can be
dropped.
