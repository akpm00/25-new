Subject: mm: remove the vma linked list

Replace any vm_next use with vma_find().

Update free_pgtables(), unmap_vmas(), and zap_page_range() to use the
maple tree.

Use the new free_pgtables() and unmap_vmas() in do_mas_align_munmap().  At
the same time, alter the loop to be more compact.

Now that free_pgtables() and unmap_vmas() take a maple tree as an
argument, rearrange do_mas_align_munmap() to use the new tree to hold the
vmas to remove.

Remove __vma_link_list() and __vma_unlink_list() as they are exclusively
used to update the linked list

Drop linked list update from __insert_vm_struct().

Rework validation of tree as it was depending on the linked list.
