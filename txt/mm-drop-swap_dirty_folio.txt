Subject: mm: drop swap_dirty_folio

folios that are written to swap are owned by the MM subsystem - not any
filesystem.

When such a folio is passed to a filesystem to be written out to a
swap-file, the filesystem handles the data, but the folio itself does not
belong to the filesystem.  So calling the filesystem's ->dirty_folio()
address_space operation makes no sense.  This is for folios in the given
address space, and a folio to be written to swap does not exist in the
given address space.

So drop swap_dirty_folio() which calls the address-space's
->dirty_folio(), and always use noop_dirty_folio(), which is appropriate
for folios being swapped out.
