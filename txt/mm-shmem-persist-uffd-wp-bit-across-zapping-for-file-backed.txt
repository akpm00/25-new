Subject: mm/shmem: persist uffd-wp bit across zapping for file-backed

File-backed memory is prone to being unmapped at any time.  It means all
information in the pte will be dropped, including the uffd-wp flag.

To persist the uffd-wp flag, we'll use the pte markers.  This patch
teaches the zap code to understand uffd-wp and know when to keep or drop
the uffd-wp bit.

Add a new flag ZAP_FLAG_DROP_MARKER and set it in zap_details when we
don't want to persist such an information, for example, when destroying
the whole vma, or punching a hole in a shmem file.  For the rest cases we
should never drop the uffd-wp bit, or the wr-protect information will get
lost.

The new ZAP_FLAG_DROP_MARKER needs to be put into mm.h rather than
memory.c because it'll be further referenced in hugetlb files later.
