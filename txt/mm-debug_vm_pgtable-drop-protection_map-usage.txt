Subject: mm/debug_vm_pgtable: drop protection_map[] usage

Patch series "mm: protection_map[] cleanups".


This patch (of 2):

Although protection_map[] contains the platform defined page protection
map for a given vm_flags combination, vm_get_page_prot() is the right
interface to use.  This will also reduce dependency on protection_map[]
which is going to be dropped off completely later on.
