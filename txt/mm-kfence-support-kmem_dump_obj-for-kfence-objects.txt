Subject: mm, kfence: support kmem_dump_obj() for KFENCE objects

Calling kmem_obj_info() via kmem_dump_obj() on KFENCE objects has been
producing garbage data due to the object not actually being maintained by
SLAB or SLUB.

Fix this by implementing __kfence_obj_info() that copies relevant
information to struct kmem_obj_info when the object was allocated by
KFENCE; this is called by a common kmem_obj_info(), which also calls the
slab/slub/slob specific variant now called __kmem_obj_info().

For completeness, kmem_dump_obj() now displays if the object was allocated
by KFENCE.
