Subject: mm/z3fold: remove buggy use of stale list for allocation

Currently if z3fold couldn't find an unbuddied page it would first try to
pull a page off the stale list.  But this approach is problematic.  If
init z3fold page fails later, the page should be freed via
free_z3fold_page to clean up the relevant resource instead of using
__free_page directly.  And if page is successfully reused, it will BUG_ON
later in __SetPageMovable because it's already non-lru movable page, i.e. 
PAGE_MAPPING_MOVABLE is already set in page->mapping.  In order to fix all
of these issues, we can simply remove the buggy use of stale list for
allocation because can_sleep should always be false and we never really
hit the reusing code path now.
