Subject: mm/vmalloc: fix spinning drain_vmap_work after reading from /proc/vmcore

Commit 3ee48b6af49c ("mm, x86: Saving vmcore with non-lazy freeing of
vmas") introduced set_iounmap_nonlazy(), which sets vmap_lazy_nr to
lazy_max_pages() + 1, ensuring that any future vunmaps() immediately
purges the vmap areas instead of doing it lazily.

Commit 690467c81b1a ("mm/vmalloc: Move draining areas out of caller
context") moved the purging from the vunmap() caller to a worker thread. 
Unfortunately, set_iounmap_nonlazy() can cause the worker thread to spin
(possibly forever).  For example, consider the following scenario:

1. Thread reads from /proc/vmcore. This eventually calls
   __copy_oldmem_page() -> set_iounmap_nonlazy(), which sets
   vmap_lazy_nr to lazy_max_pages() + 1.
2. Then it calls free_vmap_area_noflush() (via iounmap()), which adds 2
   pages (one page plus the guard page) to the purge list and
   vmap_lazy_nr. vmap_lazy_nr is now lazy_max_pages() + 3, so the
   drain_vmap_work is scheduled.
3. Thread returns from the kernel and is scheduled out.
4. Worker thread is scheduled in and calls drain_vmap_area_work(). It
   frees the 2 pages on the purge list. vmap_lazy_nr is now
   lazy_max_pages() + 1.
5. This is still over the threshold, so it tries to purge areas again,
   but doesn't find anything.
6. Repeat 5.

If the system is running with only one CPU (which is typicial for kdump)
and preemption is disabled, then this will never make forward progress:
there aren't any more pages to purge, so it hangs.  If there is more than
one CPU or preemption is enabled, then the worker thread will spin forever
in the background.  (Note that if there were already pages to be purged at
the time that set_iounmap_nonlazy() was called, this bug is avoided.)

This can be reproduced with anything that reads from /proc/vmcore multiple
times.  E.g., vmcore-dmesg /proc/vmcore.

A simple way to "fix" this would be to make set_iounmap_nonlazy() set
vmap_lazy_nr to lazy_max_pages() instead of lazy_max_pages() + 1.  But, I
think it'd be better to get rid of this hack of clobbering vmap_lazy_nr. 
Instead, this fix makes __copy_oldmem_page() explicitly drain the vmap
areas itself.
