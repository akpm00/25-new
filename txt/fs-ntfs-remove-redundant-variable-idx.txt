Subject: fs/ntfs: remove redundant variable idx
Date: Tue, 17 May 2022 10:36:46 +0100

The variable idx is assigned a value and is never read.  The variable is
not used and is redundant, remove it.

Cleans up clang scan build warning:
warning: Although the value stored to 'idx' is used in the enclosing
expression, the value is never actually read from 'idx'
[deadcode.DeadStores]
