Subject: mm/hwpoison: disable hwpoison filter during removing

hwpoison filter is enabled by hwpoison-inject module, after removing this
module, hwpoison filter still works.  What is worse, user can not find the
debugfs entries to know this.

Disable the hwpoison filter during removing hwpoison-inject module.
