Subject: mm: Kconfig: group swap, slab, hotplug and thp options into submenus

There are several clusters of related config options spread throughout the
mostly flat MM submenu.  Group them together and put specialization
options into further subdirectories to make the MM submenu a bit more
organized and easier to navigate.
