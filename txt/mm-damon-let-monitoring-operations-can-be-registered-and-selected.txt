Subject: mm/damon: let monitoring operations can be registered and selected

In-kernel DAMON user code like DAMON debugfs interface should set 'struct
damon_operations' of its 'struct damon_ctx' on its own.  Therefore, the
client code should depend on all supporting monitoring operations
implementations that it could use.  For example, DAMON debugfs interface
depends on both vaddr and paddr, while some of the users are not always
interested in both.

To minimize such unnecessary dependencies, this commit makes the
monitoring operations can be registered by implementing code and then
dynamically selected by the user code without build-time dependency.
