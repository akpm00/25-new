Subject: mm: page_alloc: avoid merging non-fallbackable pageblocks with others

This is done in addition to MIGRATE_ISOLATE pageblock merge avoidance.  It
prepares for the upcoming removal of the MAX_ORDER-1 alignment requirement
for CMA and alloc_contig_range().

MIGRATE_HIGHATOMIC should not merge with other migratetypes like
MIGRATE_ISOLATE and MIGRARTE_CMA[1], so this commit prevents that too.

Remove MIGRATE_CMA and MIGRATE_ISOLATE from fallbacks list, since they
are never used.
