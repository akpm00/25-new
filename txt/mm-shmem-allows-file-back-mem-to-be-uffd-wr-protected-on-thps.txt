Subject: mm/shmem: allows file-back mem to be uffd wr-protected on thps

We don't have "huge" version of pte markers, instead when necessary we
split the thp.

However split the thp is not enough, because file-backed thp is handled
totally differently comparing to anonymous thps: rather than doing a real
split, the thp pmd will simply got cleared in __split_huge_pmd_locked().

That is not enough if e.g.  when there is a thp covers range [0, 2M) but
we want to wr-protect small page resides in [4K, 8K) range, because after
__split_huge_pmd() returns, there will be a none pmd, and
change_pmd_range() will just skip it right after the split.

Here we leverage the previously introduced change_pmd_prepare() macro so
that we'll populate the pmd with a pgtable page after the pmd split (in
which process the pmd will be cleared for cases like shmem).  Then
change_pte_range() will do all the rest for us by installing the uffd-wp
pte marker at any none pte that we'd like to wr-protect.
