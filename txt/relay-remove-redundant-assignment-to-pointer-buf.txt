Subject: relay: remove redundant assignment to pointer buf

Pointer buf is being assigned a value that is not being read, buf is being
re-assigned in the next starement.  The assignment is redundant and can be
removed.

Cleans up clang scan build warning:
kernel/relay.c:443:8: warning: Although the value stored to 'buf' is
used in the enclosing expression, the value is never actually read
from 'buf' [deadcode.DeadStores]
