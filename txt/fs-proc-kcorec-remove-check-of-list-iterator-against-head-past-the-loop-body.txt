Subject: fs/proc/kcore.c: remove check of list iterator against head past the loop body

When list_for_each_entry() completes the iteration over the whole list
without breaking the loop, the iterator value will be a bogus pointer
computed based on the head element.

While it is safe to use the pointer to determine if it was computed based
on the head element, either with list_entry_is_head() or &pos->member ==
head, using the iterator variable after the loop should be avoided.

In preparation to limit the scope of a list iterator to the list traversal
loop, use a dedicated pointer to point to the found element [1].
