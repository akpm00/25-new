Subject: radix tree test suite: add pr_err define

Patch series "Introducing the Maple Tree", v8.

The maple tree is an RCU-safe range based B-tree designed to use modern
processor cache efficiently.  There are a number of places in the kernel
that a non-overlapping range-based tree would be beneficial, especially
one with a simple interface.  The first user that is covered in this patch
set is the vm_area_struct, where three data structures are replaced by the
maple tree: the augmented rbtree, the vma cache, and the linked list of
VMAs in the mm_struct.  The long term goal is to reduce or remove the
mmap_lock contention.

The tree has a branching factor of 10 for non-leaf nodes and 16 for leaf
nodes.  With the increased branching factor, it is significantly shorter
than the rbtree so it has fewer cache misses.  The removal of the linked
list between subsequent entries also reduces the cache misses and the need
to pull in the previous and next VMA during many tree alterations.
