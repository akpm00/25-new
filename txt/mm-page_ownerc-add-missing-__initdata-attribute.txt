Subject: mm/page_owner.c: add missing __initdata attribute
Date: Mon, 16 May 2022 11:00:42 +0800

This patch fixes two issues:
1. Add __initdata attribute according to include/linux/init.h:
	For initialized data:
	You should insert __initdata between the variable name and equal
	sign followed by value

2. Fix below error reported by checkpatch.pl:
	ERROR: do not initialise statics to false

Special thanks to Muchun Song :)
