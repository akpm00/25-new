Subject: tmpfs: three tweaks to creation time patch

Thank you to Xavier Roche for his tmpfs file creation time patch.  Please
apply these 3 tweaks on top (and fold in when sending to Linus):

1. Move vfs_inode back to being last element of shmem_inode_info.
2. Remove unnecessary parentheses from condition in shmem_getattr().
3. Using shmem_getattr() on other file types than regular requires that
   shmem_is_huge() check type, to stop incorrect HPAGE_PMD_SIZE blksize.
