Subject: mm/migration: remove unneeded lock page and PageMovable check

When non-lru movable page was freed from under us, __ClearPageMovable must
have been done.  Even if it's not done, ClearPageIsolated here won't hurt
as page will be freed anyway.  So we can thus remove unneeded lock page
and PageMovable check here.
