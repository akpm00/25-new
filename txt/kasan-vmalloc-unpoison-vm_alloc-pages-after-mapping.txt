Subject: kasan, vmalloc: unpoison VM_ALLOC pages after mapping

Make KASAN unpoison vmalloc mappings after they have been mapped in when
it's possible: for vmalloc() (indentified via VM_ALLOC) and vm_map_ram().

The reasons for this are:

- For vmalloc() and vm_map_ram(): pages don't get unpoisoned in case
  mapping them fails.
- For vmalloc(): HW_TAGS KASAN needs pages to be mapped to set tags via
  kasan_unpoison_vmalloc().

As a part of these changes, the return value of __vmalloc_node_range() is
changed to area->addr.  This is a non-functional change, as
__vmalloc_area_node() returns area->addr anyway.
