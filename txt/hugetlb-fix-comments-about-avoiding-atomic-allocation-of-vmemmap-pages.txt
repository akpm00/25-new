Subject: hugetlb: fix comments about avoiding atomic allocation of vmemmap pages

Since there is no longer an atomic allocation of vmemmap pages, but a
fixed flag(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NORETRY | __GFP_THISNODE) is used.  The
description of atomicity here is some what inappropriate.

And the atomic parameter naming of update_and_free_page() may be
misleading, add a comment here.
