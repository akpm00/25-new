Subject: include/linux/mmdebug.h: fix VM_WARN[_*]() with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM=n

These macros cause the build to break when someone uses their return value
with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM=n:

	if (VM_WARN(from > to, "%s called with a negative range\n", __func__))
 		return -EINVAL;

mm/hugetlb.c: In function 'hugetlb_reserve_pages':
mm/hugetlb.c:4378: error: void value not ignored as it ought to be

Fix this up.
