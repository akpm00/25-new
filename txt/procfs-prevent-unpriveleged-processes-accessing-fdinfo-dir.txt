Subject: procfs: prevent unprivileged processes accessing fdinfo dir

The file permissions on the fdinfo dir from were changed from
S_IRUSR|S_IXUSR to S_IRUGO|S_IXUGO, and a PTRACE_MODE_READ check was added
for opening the fdinfo files [1].  However, the ptrace permission check
was not added to the directory, allowing anyone to get the open FD numbers
by reading the fdinfo directory.

Add the missing ptrace permission check for opening the fdinfo directory.
