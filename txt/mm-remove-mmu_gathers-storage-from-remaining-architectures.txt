Subject: mm: remove mmu_gathers storage from remaining architectures

Originally the mmu_gathers were removed in commit 1c3951769621 ("mm: now
that all old mmu_gather code is gone, remove the storage").  However, the
openrisc and hexagon architecture were merged around the same time and
mmu_gathers was not removed.

This patch removes them from openrisc, hexagon and nds32:

Noticed while cleaning this warning:

    arch/openrisc/mm/init.c:41:1: warning: symbol 'mmu_gathers' was not declared. Should it be static?
