Subject: kselftest/vm: override TARGETS from arguments

We can specify which testcases to build using TARGETS argument, for
example: make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=vm, cause the ordinary
assignment of TARGETS in Makefile will be ignored.  So we need to use
override directive to change that.
