Subject: revert "mm/z3fold.c: allow __GFP_HIGHMEM in z3fold_alloc"

Revert commit f1549cb5ab2b ("mm/z3fold.c: allow __GFP_HIGHMEM in
z3fold_alloc").

z3fold can't support GFP_HIGHMEM page now.  page_address is used directly
at all places.  Moreover, z3fold_header is on per cpu unbuddied list which
could be access anytime.  So we should rid the support of GFP_HIGHMEM
allocation for z3fold.
