Subject: mm: Kconfig: simplify zswap configuration

- CONFIG_ZRAM: Zram is a user-facing feature, whereas zsmalloc is
  not. Don't make the user chase down a technical dependency like
  that, just select it in automatically when zram is requested. The
  CONFIG_CRYPTO dependency is redundant due to more specific deps.

- CONFIG_ZPOOL: This is not a user-facing feature. Hide the symbol and
  have it selected in as needed.

- CONFIG_ZSWAP: Select CRYPTO instead of depend. Common pattern.

- Make the ZSWAP suboptions and their descriptions (compression,
  allocation backend) a bit more straight-forward for the user.
