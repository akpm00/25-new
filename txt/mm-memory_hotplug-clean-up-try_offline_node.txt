Subject: mm/memory_hotplug: clean up try_offline_node

We can use helper macro node_spanned_pages to check whether node spans
pages.  And we can change the parameter of check_cpu_on_node to nid as
that's what it really cares.  Thus we can further get rid of the local
variable pgdat and improve the readability a bit.
