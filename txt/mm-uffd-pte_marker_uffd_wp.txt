Subject: mm/uffd: PTE_MARKER_UFFD_WP

This patch introduces the 1st user of pte marker: the uffd-wp marker.

When the pte marker is installed with the uffd-wp bit set, it means this
pte was wr-protected by uffd.

We will use this special pte to arm the ptes that got either unmapped or
swapped out for a file-backed region that was previously wr-protected. 
This special pte could trigger a page fault just like swap entries.

This idea is greatly inspired by Hugh and Andrea in the discussion, which
is referenced in the links below.

Some helpers are introduced to detect whether a swap pte is uffd
wr-protected.  After the pte marker introduced, one swap pte can be
wr-protected in two forms: either it is a normal swap pte and it has
_PAGE_SWP_UFFD_WP set, or it's a pte marker that has PTE_MARKER_UFFD_WP
set.
