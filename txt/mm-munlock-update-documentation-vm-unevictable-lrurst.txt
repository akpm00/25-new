Subject: mm/munlock: update Documentation/vm/unevictable-lru.rst

Update Documentation/vm/unevictable-lru.rst to reflect the changes made by
the mm/munlock series: keeping an mlock_count instead of page_mlock()
(formerly try_to_munlock()) and munlock_vma_pages_all() etc.  Also make
other little updates or cleanups wherever noticed.

But, I apologize, this is already out of date, in that "folio" appears
nowhere: 5.18 will be in a transitional state from "page" to "folio", and
documenting its current mix of the two does not help to understand "the
Unevictable LRU".  Should be revisited when naming is more settled.
