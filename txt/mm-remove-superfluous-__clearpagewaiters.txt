Subject: mm: remove superfluous __ClearPageWaiters()

Presumably __ClearPageWaiters() was added to follow the previously removed
__ClearPageActive() pattern.

Only flags that are in PAGE_FLAGS_CHECK_AT_FREE needs to be properly
cleared because otherwise we think there may be some kind of leak. 
PG_waiters is not one of those flags and leaving the clearing to
PAGE_FLAGS_CHECK_AT_PREP is more appropriate.
