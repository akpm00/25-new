Subject: include/linux/swapops.h: remove stub for non_swap_entry()

The stub for non_swap_entry() may not help much, because MAX_SWAPFILES has
already contained all the information to decide whether a swap entry is
real swap entry or pesudo ones (migrations, ...).

There can be some performance influences on non_swap_entry() with below
conditions all met:

  !CONFIG_MIGRATION && !CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE && !CONFIG_DEVICE_PRIVATE

But that's definitely not the major config most machines will use, at the
meantime it's already in a slow path of swap entry (being parsed from a
swap pte), so IMHO it shouldn't be a major issue.  Also according to the
analysis from Alistair, somehow the stub didn't do the job right [1].

To make the code cleaner, let's drop the stub.

Note: the uffd-wp shmem & hugetlbfs series will need this patch to make
sure swap entries work as expected with below config as spotted by
Alistair:

  !CONFIG_MIGRATION &&
  !CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE &&
  !CONFIG_DEVICE_PRIVATE &&
  CONFIG_PTE_MARKER

(PS: this config should mostly never gonna happen, though, afaict..)
