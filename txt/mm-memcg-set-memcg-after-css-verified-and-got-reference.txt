Subject: mm/memcg: set memcg after css verified and got reference

Patch series "mm/memcg: some cleanup for mem_cgroup_iter()", v2.

No functional change, try to make it more readable.


This patch (of 3):

Instead of resetting memcg when css is either not verified or not got
reference, we can set it after these process.

No functional change, just simplified the code a little.
