Subject: fs/inode: avoid unused-variable warning

Now that 'inodes_stat' is marked 'static', it causes a harmless warning
whenever it is unused:

fs/inode.c:73:29: error: 'inodes_stat' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-variable]
   73 | static struct inodes_stat_t inodes_stat;

Move it into the #ifdef that guards its only references.
