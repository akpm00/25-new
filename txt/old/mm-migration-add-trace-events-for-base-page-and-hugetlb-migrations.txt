Subject: mm/migration: add trace events for base page and HugeTLB migrations

This adds two trace events for base page and HugeTLB page migrations. 
These events, closely follow the implementation details like setting and
removing of PTE migration entries, which are essential operations for
migration.  The new CREATE_TRACE_POINTS in <mm/rmap.c> covers both
<events/migration.h> and <events/tlb.h> based trace events.  Hence drop
redundant CREATE_TRACE_POINTS from other places which could have otherwise
conflicted during build.
