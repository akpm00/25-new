Subject: tmpfs: support for file creation time

Various filesystems (including ext4) now support file creation time.  This
patch adds such support for tmpfs-based filesystems.

Note that using shmem_getattr() on other file types than regular requires
that shmem_is_huge() check type, to stop incorrect HPAGE_PMD_SIZE blksize.
