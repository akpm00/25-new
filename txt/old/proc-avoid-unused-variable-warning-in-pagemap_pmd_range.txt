Subject: proc: avoid unused variable warning in pagemap_pmd_range()

When building with CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=n, there is a warning about
migration being unused:

  fs/proc/task_mmu.c:1444:7: warning: unused variable 'migration' [-Wunused-variable]
          bool migration = false;
               ^
  1 warning generated.

Move the ifdef preprocessor directive up to include migration so it is
only included in the file when it is used.
