Subject: x86/mm: enable ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT

This defines and exports a platform specific custom vm_get_page_prot() via
subscribing ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT.  Subsequently all __SXXX and __PXXX
macros can be dropped which are no longer needed.  This also unsubscribes
from ARCH_HAS_FILTER_PGPROT, after dropping off arch_filter_pgprot() and
arch_vm_get_page_prot().
