Subject: mm: page_table_check: using PxD_SIZE instead of PxD_PAGE_SIZE

Patch series "mm: page_table_check: add support on arm64 and riscv", v7.

Page table check performs extra verifications at the time when new pages
become accessible from the userspace by getting their page table entries
(PTEs PMDs etc.) added into the table.  It is supported on X86[1].

This patchset made some simple changes and make it easier to support new
architecture, then we support this feature on ARM64 and RISCV.

This patch (of 6):

Compared with PxD_PAGE_SIZE, which is defined and used only on X86,
PxD_SIZE is more common in each architecture.  Therefore, it is more
reasonable to use PxD_SIZE instead of PxD_PAGE_SIZE in page_table_check.c.
At the same time, it is easier to support page table check in other
architectures.  The substitution has no functional impact on the x86.
