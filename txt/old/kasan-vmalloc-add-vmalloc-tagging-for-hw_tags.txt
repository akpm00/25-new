Subject: kasan, vmalloc: add vmalloc tagging for HW_TAGS

Add vmalloc tagging support to HW_TAGS KASAN.

The key difference between HW_TAGS and the other two KASAN modes when it
comes to vmalloc: HW_TAGS KASAN can only assign tags to physical memory. 
The other two modes have shadow memory covering every mapped virtual
memory region.

Make __kasan_unpoison_vmalloc() for HW_TAGS KASAN:

- Skip non-VM_ALLOC mappings as HW_TAGS KASAN can only tag a single
  mapping of normal physical memory; see the comment in the function.
- Generate a random tag, tag the returned pointer and the allocation,
  and initialize the allocation at the same time.
- Propagate the tag into the page stucts to allow accesses through
  page_address(vmalloc_to_page()).

The rest of vmalloc-related KASAN hooks are not needed:

- The shadow-related ones are fully skipped.
- __kasan_poison_vmalloc() is kept as a no-op with a comment.

Poisoning and zeroing of physical pages that are backing vmalloc()
allocations are skipped via __GFP_SKIP_KASAN_UNPOISON and __GFP_SKIP_ZERO:
__kasan_unpoison_vmalloc() does that instead.

Enabling CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC with HW_TAGS is not yet allowed.
