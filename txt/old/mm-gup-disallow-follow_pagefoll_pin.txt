Subject: mm/gup: disallow follow_page(FOLL_PIN)

We want to change the way we handle R/O pins on anonymous pages that might
be shared: if we detect a possibly shared anonymous page -- mapped R/O and
not !PageAnonExclusive() -- we want to trigger unsharing via a page fault,
resulting in an exclusive anonymous page that can be pinned reliably
without getting replaced via COW on the next write fault.

However, the required page fault will be problematic for follow_page(): in
contrast to ordinary GUP, follow_page() doesn't trigger faults internally.
So we would have to end up failing a R/O pin via follow_page(), although
there is something mapped R/O into the page table, which might be rather
surprising.

We don't seem to have follow_page(FOLL_PIN) users, and it's a purely
internal MM function.  Let's just make our life easier and the semantics
of follow_page() clearer by just disallowing FOLL_PIN for follow_page()
completely.
