Subject: mm/vmscan: don't use NUMA_NO_NODE as indicator of page on different node

Now we are sure there is at least one page on page_list, so it is safe to
get the nid of it.  This means it is not necessary to use NUMA_NO_NODE as
an indicator for the beginning of iteration or a page on different node.
