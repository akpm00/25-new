Subject: mm/uffd: hide PTE_MARKER option

The PTE_MARKER option should not need to be exposed to the kernel builder,
keep it internal and remove the prompt so it won't be seen.

Instead, make the PTE_MARKER_UFFD_WP option to explicitly choose
PTE_MARKER when necessary.

While PTE_MARKER_UFFD_WP will still prompt to user, change the wording so
that it'll not mention PTE_MARKER at all but renaming it to "Userfaultfd
write protection support for shmem/hugetlbfs".
