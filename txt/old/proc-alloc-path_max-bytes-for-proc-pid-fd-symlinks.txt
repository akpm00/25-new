Subject: proc: alloc PATH_MAX bytes for /proc/${pid}/fd/ symlinks

It's not a standard approach that use __get_free_page() to alloc path
buffer directly.  We'd better use kmalloc and PATH_MAX.

	PAGE_SIZE is different on different archs. An unlinked file
	with very long canonical pathname will readlink differently
	because "(deleted)" eats into a buffer.	--adobriyan
