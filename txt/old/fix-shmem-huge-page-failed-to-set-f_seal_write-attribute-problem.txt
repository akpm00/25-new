Subject: memfd: fix shmem huge page failed to set F_SEAL_WRITE attribute problem

After enabling tmpfs filesystem to support transparent hugepage with the
following command:

 echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/shmem_enabled

The docker program adds F_SEAL_WRITE through the following command which
will prompt EBUSY.

 fcntl(5, F_ADD_SEALS, F_SEAL_WRITE)=-1.

It is found that in memfd_wait_for_pins function, the page_count of
hugepage is 512 and page_mapcount is 0, which does not meet the
conditions:

 page_count(page) - page_mapcount(page) != 1.

But the page is not busy at this time, therefore, the page_order of
hugepage should be taken into account in the calculation.
