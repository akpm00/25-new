Subject: mm/fs: delete PF_SWAPWRITE

PF_SWAPWRITE has been redundant since v3.2 commit ee72886d8ed5 ("mm:
vmscan: do not writeback filesystem pages in direct reclaim").

Coincidentally, NeilBrown's current patch "remove inode_congested()"
deletes may_write_to_inode(), which appeared to be the one function which
took notice of PF_SWAPWRITE.  But if you study the old logic, and the
conditions under which may_write_to_inode() was called, you discover that
flag and function have been pointless for a decade.
