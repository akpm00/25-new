Subject: mm/mempolicy: clean up the code logic in queue_pages_pte_range

Since commit e5947d23edd8 ("mm: mempolicy: don't have to split pmd for
huge zero page"), THP is never splited in queue_pages_pmd.  Thus 2 is
never returned now.  We can remove such unnecessary ret != 2 check and
clean up the relevant comment.  Minor improvements in readability.
