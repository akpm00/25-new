Subject: memory tiering: skip to scan fast memory

If the NUMA balancing isn't used to optimize the page placement among
sockets but only among memory types, the hot pages in the fast memory node
couldn't be migrated (promoted) to anywhere.  So it's unnecessary to scan
the pages in the fast memory node via changing their PTE/PMD mapping to be
PROT_NONE.  So that the page faults could be avoided too.

In the test, if only the memory tiering NUMA balancing mode is enabled,
the number of the NUMA balancing hint faults for the DRAM node is reduced
to almost 0 with the patch.  While the benchmark score doesn't change
visibly.
