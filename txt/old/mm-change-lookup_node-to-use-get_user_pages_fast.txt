Subject: mm: change lookup_node() to use get_user_pages_fast()

The purpose of calling get_user_pages_locked() from lookup_node() was to
allow for unlocking the mmap_lock when reading a page from the disk during
a page fault (hidden behind VM_FAULT_RETRY).  The idea was to reduce
contention on the heavily-used mmap_lock.  (Thanks to Jan Kara for clearly
pointing that out, and in fact I've used some of his wording here.)

However, it is unlikely for lookup_node() to take a page fault.  With that
in mind, change over to calling get_user_pages_fast().  This simplifies
the code, runs a little faster in the expected case, and allows removing
get_user_pages_locked() entirely, in a subsequent patch.
