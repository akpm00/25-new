Subject: nfs: rename nfs_direct_IO and use as ->swap_rw

The nfs_direct_IO() exists to support SWAP IO, but hasn't worked for a
while.  We now need a ->swap_rw function which behaves slightly
differently, returning zero for success rather than a byte count.

So modify nfs_direct_IO accordingly, rename it, and use it as the
->swap_rw function.
