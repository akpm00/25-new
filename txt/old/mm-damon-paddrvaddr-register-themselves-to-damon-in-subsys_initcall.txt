Subject: mm/damon/paddr,vaddr: register themselves to DAMON in subsys_initcall

This commit makes the monitoring operations for the physical address space
and virtual address spaces register themselves to DAMON in the
subsys_initcall step.  Later, in-kernel DAMON user code can use them via
damon_select_ops() without have to unnecessarily depend on all possible
monitoring operations implementations.
