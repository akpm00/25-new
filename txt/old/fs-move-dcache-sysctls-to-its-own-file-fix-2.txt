Subject: fs/dcache: avoid unused-function warning

Now that 'dentry_stat' is marked 'static', we can run into this warning:

fs/dcache.c:128:29: error: 'dentry_stat' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-variable]
  128 | static struct dentry_stat_t dentry_stat = {

Hide it in the same #ifdef as its only references.
