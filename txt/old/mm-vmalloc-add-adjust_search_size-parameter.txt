Subject: mm/vmalloc: add adjust_search_size parameter

Extend the find_vmap_lowest_match() function with one more parameter.  It
is "adjust_search_size" boolean variable, so it is possible to control an
accuracy of search block if a specific alignment is required.

With this patch, a search size is always adjusted, to serve a request as
fast as possible because of performance reason.

But there is one exception though, it is short ranges where requested size
corresponds to passed vstart/vend restriction together with a specific
alignment request.  In such scenario an adjustment wold not lead to
success allocation.
