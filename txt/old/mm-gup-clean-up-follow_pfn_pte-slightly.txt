Subject: mm/gup: clean up follow_pfn_pte() slightly

Regardless of any FOLL_* flags, get_user_pages() and its variants should
handle PFN-only entries by stopping early, if the caller expected **pages
to be filled in.

This makes for a more reliable API, as compared to the previous approach
of skipping over such entries (and thus leaving them silently unwritten).
