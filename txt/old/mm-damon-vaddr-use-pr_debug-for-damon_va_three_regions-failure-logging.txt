Subject: mm/damon/vaddr: use pr_debug() for damon_va_three_regions() failure logging

Failure of 'damon_va_three_regions()' is logged using 'pr_err()'.  But,
the function can fail in legal situations.  To avoid making users be
surprised and to keep the kernel clean, this commit makes the log to be
printed using 'pr_debug()'.
