Subject: mm/gup: remove get_user_pages_locked()

There is only one caller of get_user_pages_locked().  The purpose of
get_user_pages_locked() is to allow for unlocking the mmap_lock when
reading a page from the disk during a page fault (hidden behind
VM_FAULT_RETRY).  The idea is to reduce contention on the heavily-used
mmap_lock.  (Thanks to Jan Kara for clearly pointing that out, and in fact
I've used some of his wording here.)

However, it is unlikely for lookup_node() to take a page fault.  With that
in mind, change over to calling get_user_pages_fast().  This simplifies
the code, runs a little faster in the expected case, and allows removing
get_user_pages_locked() entirely.
