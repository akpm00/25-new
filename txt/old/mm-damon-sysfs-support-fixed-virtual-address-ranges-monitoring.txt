Subject: mm/damon/sysfs: support fixed virtual address ranges monitoring

This commit makes DAMON sysfs interface to support the fixed virtual
address ranges monitoring.  After this commit, writing 'fvaddr' to the
'operations' DAMON sysfs file makes DAMON uses the monitoring operations
set for fixed virtual address ranges, so that users can monitor accesses
to only interested virtual address ranges.
