Subject: mm: __isolate_lru_page_prepare() in isolate_migratepages_block()

__isolate_lru_page_prepare() conflates two unrelated functions, with the
flags to one disjoint from the flags to the other; and hides some of the
important checks outside of isolate_migratepages_block(), where the
sequence is better to be visible.  It comes from the days of lumpy
reclaim, before compaction, when the combination made more sense.

Move what's needed by mm/compaction.c isolate_migratepages_block() inline
there, and what's needed by mm/vmscan.c isolate_lru_pages() inline there.

Shorten "isolate_mode" to "mode", so the sequence of conditions is easier
to read.  Declare a "mapping" variable, to save one call to page_mapping()
(but not another: calling again after page is locked is necessary). 
Simplify isolate_lru_pages() with a "move_to" list pointer.
