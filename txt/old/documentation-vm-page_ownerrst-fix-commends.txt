Subject: Documentation/vm/page_owner.rst: fix comments

There are some comments that need to be fixed.

Thanks for Shuah Khan's constructive suggestions.  The comments have been
fixed as follows.

a. So, if you'd like to use it, you need
to add "page_owner=on" into your boot cmdline.

Here, "into" has been replaced with "to".

b. ...page owner is disabled in runtime due to no
enabling, boot option, runtime overhead is marginal.

Here, "no" has been replaced with "not".
