Subject: mm/damon: implement a minimal stub for sysfs-based DAMON interface

DAMON's debugfs-based user interface served very well, so far.  However,
it unnecessarily depends on debugfs, while DAMON is not aimed to be used
for only debugging.  Also, the interface receives multiple values via one
file.  For example, schemes file receives 18 values separated by white
spaces.  As a result, it is ineffient, hard to be used, and difficult to
be extended.  Especially, keeping backward compatibility of user space
tools is getting only challenging.  It would be better to implement
another reliable and flexible interface and deprecate the debugfs
interface in long term.

To this end, this commit implements a stub of a part of the new user
interface of DAMON using sysfs.  Specifically, this commit implements the
sysfs control parts for virtual address space monitoring.

More specifically, the idea of the new interface is, using directory
hierarchies and making one file for one value.  The hierarchy that this
commit is introducing is as below.  In the below figure, parents-children
relations are represented with indentations, each directory is having
``/`` suffix, and files in each directory are separated by comma (",").

    /sys/kernel/mm/damon/admin
    │ kdamonds/nr_kdamonds
    │ │ 0/state,pid
    │ │ │ contexts/nr_contexts
    │ │ │ │ 0/operations
    │ │ │ │ │ monitoring_attrs/
    │ │ │ │ │ │ intervals/sample_us,aggr_us,update_us
    │ │ │ │ │ │ nr_regions/min,max
    │ │ │ │ │ targets/nr_targets
    │ │ │ │ │ │ 0/pid_target
    │ │ │ │ │ │ ...
    │ │ │ │ ...
    │ │ ...

Writing a number <N> to each 'nr' file makes directories of name <0> to
<N-1> in the directory of the 'nr' file.  That's all this commit does. 
Writing proper values to relevant files will construct the DAMON contexts,
and writing a special keyword, 'on', to 'state' files for each kdamond
will ask DAMON to start the constructed contexts.

For a short example, using below commands for monitoring virtual address
spaces of a given workload is imaginable:

    # cd /sys/kernel/mm/damon/admin/
    # echo 1 > kdamonds/nr_kdamonds
    # echo 1 > kdamonds/0/contexts/nr_contexts
    # echo vaddr > kdamonds/0/contexts/0/operations
    # echo 1 > kdamonds/0/contexts/0/targets/nr_targets
    # echo $(pidof <workload>) > kdamonds/0/contexts/0/targets/0/pid_target
    # echo on > kdamonds/0/state

Please note that this commit is implementing only the sysfs part stub as
abovely mentioned.  This commit doesn't implement the special keywords for
'state' files.  Following commits will do that.
