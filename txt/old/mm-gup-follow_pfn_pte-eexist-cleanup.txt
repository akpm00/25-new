Subject: mm/gup: follow_pfn_pte(): -EEXIST cleanup

Remove a quirky special case from follow_pfn_pte(), and adjust its callers
to match.  Caller changes include:

__get_user_pages(): Regardless of any FOLL_* flags, get_user_pages() and
its variants should handle PFN-only entries by stopping early, if the
caller expected **pages to be filled in.  This makes for a more reliable
API, as compared to the previous approach of skipping over such entries
(and thus leaving them silently unwritten).

move_pages(): squash the -EEXIST error return from follow_page() into
-EFAULT, because -EFAULT is listed in the man page, whereas -EEXIST is
not.
