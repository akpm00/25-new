Subject: mm/damon/dbgfs: use damon_select_ops() instead of damon_{v,p}a_set_operations()

This commit makes DAMON debugfs interface to select the registered
monitoring operations for the physical address space or virtual address
spaces depending on user requests instead of setting it on its own.  Note
that DAMON debugfs interface is still dependent to DAMON_VADDR with this
change, because it is also using its symbol, 'damon_va_target_valid'.
