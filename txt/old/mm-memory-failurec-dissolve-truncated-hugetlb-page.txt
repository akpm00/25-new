Subject: mm/memory-failure.c: dissolve truncated hugetlb page

If me_huge_page meets a truncated but not yet freed hugepage, it won't be
dissolved even if we hold the last refcnt. It's because the hugepage has
NULL page_mapping while it's not anonymous hugepage too. Thus we lose the
last chance to dissolve it into buddy to save healthy subpages. Remove
PageAnon check to handle these hugepages too.
