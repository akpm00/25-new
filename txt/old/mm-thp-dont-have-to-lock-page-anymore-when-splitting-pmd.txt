Subject: mm: thp: don't have to lock page anymore when splitting PMD

commit c444eb564fb1 ("mm: thp: make the THP mapcount atomic against
__split_huge_pmd_locked()") locked the page for PMD split to make mapcount
stable for reuse_swap_page(), then commit 1c2f67308af4 ("mm: thp: fix
MADV_REMOVE deadlock on shmem THP") reduce the scope to anonymous page
only.

However COW has not used mapcount to determine if the page is shared or
not anymore due to the COW fixes [1] from David Hildenbrand and the
reuse_swap_page() was removed as well.  So PMD split doesn't have to lock
the page anymore.  This patch basically reverted the above two commits.
