Subject: shmem: mapping_set_exiting() to help mapped resilience

When I added page_mapped() resilience in __delete_from_page_cache() for
the mapping_exiting() case, I missed that mapping_set_exiting() is done in
truncate_inode_pages_final(), which is not actually called for shmem. 
(Today, it is folio_mapped() resilience in filemap_unaccount_folio().)

So the fixup to avoid a memory leak in this case never worked on shmem:
add a mapping_set_exiting() in shmem_evict_inode() at last.  But this is
hardly a candidate for stable, since it's only useful if "Bad page".
