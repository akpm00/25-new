Subject: memcg: unify force charging conditions

Currently the kernel force charges the allocations which have __GFP_HIGH
flag without triggering the memory reclaim.  __GFP_HIGH indicates that the
caller is high priority and since commit 869712fd3de5 ("mm: memcontrol:
fix network errors from failing __GFP_ATOMIC charges") the kernel lets
such allocations do force charging.  Please note that __GFP_ATOMIC has
been replaced by __GFP_HIGH.

__GFP_HIGH does not tell if the caller can block or can trigger reclaim. 
There are separate checks to determine that.  So, there is no need to skip
reclaiming for __GFP_HIGH allocations.  So, handle __GFP_HIGH together
with __GFP_NOFAIL which also does force charging.

Please note that this is a noop change as there are no __GFP_HIGH
allocators in the kernel which also have __GFP_ACCOUNT (or SLAB_ACCOUNT)
and does not allow reclaim for now.
