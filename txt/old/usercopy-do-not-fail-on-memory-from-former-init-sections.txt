Subject: usercopy: do not fail on memory from former init sections

On some platforms the memory area between the _stext and the _etext
symbols includes the init sections (parisc and csky).  If the init
sections are freed after bootup, the kernel may reuse this memory.

In one test the usercopy checks if the given address is inside the .text
section (from _stext to _etext), and it wrongly fails on the mentioned
platforms if the memory is from the former init section.

Fix this failure by first checking against the init sections before
checking against the _stext/_etext section.
