Subject: selftests: memcg: test high limit for single entry allocation

Test the enforcement of memory.high limit for large amount of memory
allocation within a single kernel entry.  There are valid use-cases where
the application can trigger large amount of memory allocation within a
single syscall e.g.  mlock() or mmap(MAP_POPULATE).  Make sure memory.high
limit enforcement works for such use-cases.
