Subject: mm, memory_hotplug: make arch_alloc_nodedata independent on CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG

Patch series "mm, memory_hotplug: handle unitialized numa node gracefully".

The core of the fix is patch 2 which also links existing bug reports.  The
high level goal is to have all possible numa nodes have their pgdat
allocated and initialized so 

	for_each_possible_node(nid)
		NODE_DATA(nid)

will never return garbage.  This has proven to be problem in several
places when an offline numa node is used for an allocation just to realize
that node_data and therefore allocation fallback zonelists are not
initialized and such an allocation request blows up.

There were attempts to address that by checking node_online in several
places including the page allocator.  This patchset approaches the problem
from a different perspective and instead of special casing, which just
adds a runtime overhead, it allocates pglist_data for each possible node. 
This can add some memory overhead for platforms with high number of
possible nodes if they do not contain any memory.  This should be a rather
rare configuration though.

How to test this? David has provided and excellent howto:
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/6e5ebc19-890c-b6dd-1924-9f25c441010d@redhat.com

Patches 1 and 3-6 are mostly cleanups.  The patchset has been reviewed by
Rafael (thanks!) and the core fix tested by Rafael and Alexey (thanks to
both).  David has tested as per instructions above and hasn't found any
fallouts in the memory hotplug scenarios.


This patch (of 6):

This is a preparatory patch and it doesn't introduce any functional
change.  It merely pulls out arch_alloc_nodedata (and co) outside of
CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG because the following patch will need to call this
from the generic MM code.
