Subject: mm/mmap: use the maple tree for find_vma_prev() instead of the rbtree

Use the maple tree's advanced API and a maple state to walk the tree for
the entry at the address of the next vma, then use the maple state to walk
back one entry to find the previous entry.

Add kernel documentation comments for this API.
