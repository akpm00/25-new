Subject: tools/vm/page_owner_sort.c: fix comments

Two adjustments are made:

1. Correct a grammatical error: replace the "what" in "Do the job what
   you want to debug" with "that".

2. Replace "has not been" with "has been" in the description of the -f
   option: According to Commit b1c9ba071e7d ("tools/vm/page_owner_sort.c:
   fix the instructions for use"), the description of the "-f" option is
   "Filter out the information of blocks whose memory has been released."
