Subject: mm/vmalloc: eliminate an extra orig_gfp_mask

That extra variable has been introduced just for keeping an original
passed gfp_mask because it is updated with __GFP_NOWARN on entry, thus
error handling messages were broken.

Instead we can keep an original gfp_mask without modifying it and add an
extra __GFP_NOWARN flag together with gfp_mask as a parameter to the
vm_area_alloc_pages() function.  It will make it less confused.
