Subject: ia64: topology: use default_groups in kobj_type

There are currently 2 ways to create a set of sysfs files for a kobj_type,
through the default_attrs field, and the default_groups field.  Move the
ia64 topology sysfs code to use default_groups field which has been the
preferred way since aa30f47cf666 ("kobject: Add support for default
attribute groups to kobj_type") so that we can soon get rid of the
obsolete default_attrs field.
