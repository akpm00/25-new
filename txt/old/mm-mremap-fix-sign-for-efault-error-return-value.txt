Subject: mm: mremap: fix sign for EFAULT error return value

The mremap syscall is supposed to return a pointer to the new virtual
memory area on success, and a negative value of the error code in case of
failure.  Currently, EFAULT is returned when the VMA is not found, instead
of -EFAULT.  The users of this syscall will therefore believe the syscall
succeeded in case the VMA didn't exist, as it returns a pointer to address
0xe (0xe being the value of EFAULT).  Fix the sign of the error value.
