Subject: mm: thp: fix wrong cache flush in remove_migration_pmd()

The flush_cache_range() is supposed to be justified only if the page is
already placed in process page table, and that is done right after
flush_cache_range().  So using this interface is wrong.  And there is no
need to invalite cache since it was non-present before in
remove_migration_pmd().  So just to remove it.
