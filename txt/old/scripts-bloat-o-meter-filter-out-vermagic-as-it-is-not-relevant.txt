Subject: scripts/bloat-o-meter: filter out vermagic as it is not relevant

Seeing it as a false positive increase at the top is just noise:

   linux-head$./scripts/bloat-o-meter ../pre/vmlinux ../post/vmlinux
   add/remove: 0/571 grow/shrink: 1/9 up/down: 20/-64662 (-64642)
   Function                                     old     new   delta
   vermagic                                      49      69     +20

Since it really doesn't "grow", it makes sense to filter it out.
