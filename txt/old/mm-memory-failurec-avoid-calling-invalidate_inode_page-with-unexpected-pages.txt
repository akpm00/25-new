Subject: mm/memory-failure.c: avoid calling invalidate_inode_page() with unexpected pages

Since commit 042c4f32323b ("mm/truncate: Inline invalidate_complete_page()
into its one caller"), invalidate_inode_page() can invalidate the pages in
the swap cache because the check of page->mapping != mapping is removed. 
But invalidate_inode_page() is not expected to deal with the pages in swap
cache.  Also non-lru movable page can reach here too.  They're not page
cache pages.  Skip these pages by checking PageSwapCache and PageLRU.
