Subject: userfaultfd/selftests: fix uninitialized_var.cocci warning

Fix following coccicheck warning:
tools/testing/selftests/vm/userfaultfd.c:556:23-24:
WARNING this kind of initialization is deprecated

`unsigned long page_nr = *(&page_nr)` has the same form of
uninitialized_var() macro. I remove the redundant assignement. It has
been tested with gcc (Debian 8.3.0-6) 8.3.0.

The patch which removed uninitialized_var() is:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20121028102007.GA7547@gmail.com/ And there is
very few "/* GCC */" comments in the Linux kernel code now.
