Subject: mm/memcg: disable threshold event handlers on PREEMPT_RT

During the integration of PREEMPT_RT support, the code flow around
memcg_check_events() resulted in `twisted code'.  Moving the code around
and avoiding then would then lead to an additional local-irq-save section
within memcg_check_events().  While looking better, it adds a
local-irq-save section to code flow which is usually within an
local-irq-off block on non-PREEMPT_RT configurations.

The threshold event handler is a deprecated memcg v1 feature.  Instead of
trying to get it to work under PREEMPT_RT just disable it.  There should
be no users on PREEMPT_RT.  From that perspective it makes even less sense
to get it to work under PREEMPT_RT while having zero users.

Make memory.soft_limit_in_bytes and cgroup.event_control return
-EOPNOTSUPP on PREEMPT_RT.  Make an empty memcg_check_events() and
memcg_write_event_control() which return only -EOPNOTSUPP on PREEMPT_RT. 
Document that the two knobs are disabled on PREEMPT_RT.
