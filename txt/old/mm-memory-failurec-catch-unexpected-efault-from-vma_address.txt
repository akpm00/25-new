Subject: mm/memory-failure.c: catch unexpected -EFAULT from vma_address()

It's unexpected to walk the page table when vma_address() return -EFAULT. 
But dev_pagemap_mapping_shift() is called only when vma associated to the
error page is found already in collect_procs_{file,anon}, so vma_address()
should not return -EFAULT except with some bug, as Naoya pointed out.  We
can use VM_BUG_ON_VMA() to catch this bug here.
