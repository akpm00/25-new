Subject: mm: compaction: remove unneeded return value of kcompactd_run

Patch series "A few cleanup and fixup patches for compaction".

This series contains a few patches to clean up some obsolete comment,
remove unneeded return value and so on.  Also we fix the possible NULL
pointer dereference.  More details can be found in the respective
changelogs.


This patch (of 12):

The return value of kcompactd_run() is unused now.  Clean it up.
