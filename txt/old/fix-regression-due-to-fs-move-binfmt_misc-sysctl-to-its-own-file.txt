Subject: fix regression due to "fs: move binfmt_misc sysctl to its own file"

Commit 3ba442d5331f did not go unnoticed, binfmt-support stopped to work
on my Debian system since v5.17-rc2 (did not check with -rc1).

The existence of /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc is a precondition for attempting
to mount the binfmt_misc fs, which in turn triggers the autoload of the
binfmt_misc module.  Without it, no module is loaded and no binfmt is
available at boot.

Building as built-in or manually loading the module and mounting the fs
works fine, it's therefore only a matter of interaction with user-space.

I could try to improve the Debian systemd configuration but I can't
say anything about the other distributions.

In the meanwhile this patch restores a working system right after boot.
