Subject: lib: remove back_str initialization

Clang static analysis reports this false positive
glob.c:48:32: warning: Assigned value is garbage
  or undefined
  char const *back_pat = NULL, *back_str = back_str;
                                ^~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~

back_str is set after back_pat and it's use is protected by the !back_pat
check.  It is not necessary to initialize back_str, so remove the
initialization.
