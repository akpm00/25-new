Subject: mm/memory-failure.c: fix race with changing page more robustly

We're only intended to deal with the non-Compound page after we split thp
in memory_failure.  However, the page could have changed compound pages
due to race window.  If this happens, we could retry once to hopefully
handle the page next round.  Also remove unneeded orig_head.  It's always
equal to the hpage.  So we can use hpage directly and remove this
redundant one.
