Subject: mm/damon/dbgfs: use operations id for knowing if the target has pid

DAMON debugfs interface depends on monitoring operations for virtual
address spaces because it knows if the target has pid or not by seeing if
the context is configured to use one of the virtual address space
monitoring operation functions.  We can replace that check with 'enum
damon_ops_id' now, to make it independent.  This commit makes the change.
