Subject: mm/migration: reduce the rcu lock duration

Patch series "A few cleanup and fixup patches for migration", v2.

This series contains a few patches to remove unneeded lock page and
PageMovable check, reduce the rcu lock duration.  Also we fix potential
pte_unmap on an not mapped pte.  More details can be found in the
respective changelogs.


This patch (of 4):

rcu_read_lock is required by grabbing the task refcount but it's not
needed for ptrace_may_access.  So we could release the rcu lock after task
refcount is successfully grabbed to reduce the rcu holding time.
