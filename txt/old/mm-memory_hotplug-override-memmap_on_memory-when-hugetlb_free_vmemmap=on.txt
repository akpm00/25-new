Subject: mm: memory_hotplug: override memmap_on_memory when hugetlb_free_vmemmap=on

Freeing HugeTLB vmemmap pages is not compatible with allocating memmap
on hot added memory.  If "hugetlb_free_vmemmap=on" and
memory_hotplug.memmap_on_memory" are both passed on the kernel command
line, freeing hugetlb pages takes precedence.  However, the global
variable memmap_on_memory will still be set to 1, even though we will
not try to allocate memmap on hot added memory.

In the next patch, we want to enable or disable the feature of freeing
vmemmap pages of HugeTLB via sysctl.  We need a way to know if the
feature of memory_hotplug.memmap_on_memory is enabled when enabling the
feature of freeing vmemmap pages since those two features are not
compatible, however, the variable of "memmap_on_memory" cannot indicate
this nowadays.  Do not set "memmap_on_memory" to 1 when both parameters
are passed to cmdline, in this case, "memmap_on_memory" could indicate
if this feature is enabled by the users.

Also introduce mhp_memmap_on_memory() helper to move the definition of
"memmap_on_memory" to the scope of CONFIG_MHP_MEMMAP_ON_MEMORY.  In the
next patch, mhp_memmap_on_memory() will also be exported to be used in
hugetlb_vmemmap.c.
