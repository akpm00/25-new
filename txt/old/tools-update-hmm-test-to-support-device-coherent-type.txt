Subject: tools: update hmm-test to support device coherent type

Test cases such as migrate_fault and migrate_multiple, were modified to
explicit migrate from device to sys memory without the need of page
faults, when using device coherent type.

Snapshot test case updated to read memory device type first and based on
that, get the proper returned results migrate_ping_pong test case added to
test explicit migration from device to sys memory for both private and
coherent zone types.

Helpers to migrate from device to sys memory and vicerversa were also
added.
