Subject: lib/stackdepot: allow optional init and stack_table allocation by kvmalloc() - fixup4

Due to 4e66934eaadc ("lib: add reference counting tracking
infrastructure") landing recently to net-next adding a new stack depot
user in lib/ref_tracker.c we need to add an appropriate call to
stack_depot_init() there as well.
