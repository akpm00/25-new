Subject: xtensa: remove vma linked list walks

Use the VMA iterator instead.  Since VMA can no longer be NULL in the
loop, then deal with out-of-memory outside the loop.  This means a
slightly longer run time in the failure case (-ENOMEM) - it will run to
the end of the VMAs before erroring instead of in the middle of the loop.
