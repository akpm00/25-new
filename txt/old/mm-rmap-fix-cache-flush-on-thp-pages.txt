Subject: mm: rmap: fix cache flush on THP pages

Patch series "Fix some bugs related to ramp and dax", v7.

Patch 1-2 fix a cache flush bug, because subsequent patches depend on
those on those changes, there are placed in this series.  Patch 3-4 are
preparation for fixing a dax bug in patch 5.  Patch 6 is code cleanup
since the previous patch removes the usage of follow_invalidate_pte().


This patch (of 6):

The flush_cache_page() only remove a PAGE_SIZE sized range from the cache.
However, it does not cover the full pages in a THP except a head page. 
Replace it with flush_cache_range() to fix this issue.  At least, no
problems were found due to this.  Maybe because the architectures that
have virtual indexed caches is less.
