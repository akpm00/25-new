Subject: fs/pipe: use kvcalloc to allocate a pipe_buffer array

Right now, kcalloc is used to allocate a pipe_buffer array.  The size of
the pipe_buffer struct is 40 bytes.  kcalloc allows allocating reliably
chunks with sizes less or equal to PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER (3).  It means
that the maximum pipe size is 3.2MB in this case.

In CRIU, we use pipes to dump processes memory.  CRIU freezes a target
process, injects a parasite code into it and then this code splices memory
into pipes.  If a maximum pipe size is small, we need to do many
iterations or create many pipes.

kvcalloc attempt to allocate physically contiguous memory, but upon
failure, fall back to non-contiguous (vmalloc) allocation and so it isn't
limited by PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER.

The maximum pipe size for non-root users is limited by the
/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size sysctl that is 1MB by default, so only the root
user will be able to trigger vmalloc allocations.
