mm-damon-remove-some-no-need-func-definitions-in-damonh-file.patch[1],
which is merged in -mm but mainline yet, is making unnecessary function
prototype position changes in the damon.h.  This could make later
'git-blame' a little bit complex.  It also violates the 80 columns limit,
which is not madated but preferred and all other code of DAMON is
following.

This commit fixes those.  This should be folded into the patch before it
is sent to Linus.
