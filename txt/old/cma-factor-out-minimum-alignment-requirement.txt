Subject: cma: factor out minimum alignment requirement

Patch series "mm: enforce pageblock_order < MAX_ORDER".

Having pageblock_order >= MAX_ORDER seems to be able to happen in corner
cases and some parts of the kernel are not prepared for it.

For example, Aneesh has shown [1] that such kernels can be compiled on
ppc64 with 64k base pages by setting FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER=8, which will run
into a WARN_ON_ONCE(order >= MAX_ORDER) in comapction code right during
boot.

We can get pageblock_order >= MAX_ORDER when the default hugetlb size is
bigger than the maximum allocation granularity of the buddy, in which case
we are no longer talking about huge pages but instead gigantic pages.

Having pageblock_order >= MAX_ORDER can only make alloc_contig_range() of
such gigantic pages more likely to succeed.

Reliable use of gigantic pages either requires boot time allcoation or
CMA, no need to overcomplicate some places in the kernel to optimize for
corner cases that are broken in other areas of the kernel.


This patch (of 2):

Let's enforce pageblock_order < MAX_ORDER and simplify.

Especially patch #1 can be regarded a cleanup before:
	[PATCH v5 0/6] Use pageblock_order for cma and alloc_contig_range
	alignment. [2]
