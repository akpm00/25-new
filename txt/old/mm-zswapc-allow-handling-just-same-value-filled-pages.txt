Subject: mm/zswap.c: allow handling just same-value filled pages

Zswap has an ability to efficiently store same-value filled pages, which
can be turned on and off using the "same_filled_pages_enabled" parameter.

However, there is currently no way to enable just this (lightweight)
functionality, while not making use of the whole compressed page storage
machinery.

Add a "non_same_filled_pages_enabled" parameter which allows disabling
handling of pages that aren't same-value filled.  This way zswap can be
run in such lightweight same-value filled pages only mode.
