Subject: cgroup: account for memory_localevents in test_memcg_oom_group_leaf_events()

The test_memcg_oom_group_leaf_events() testcase in the cgroup memcg tests
validates that processes in a group that perform allocations exceeding
memory.oom.group are killed.  It also validates that the
memory.events.oom_kill events are properly propagated in this case.

Commit 06e11c907ea4 ("kselftests: memcg: update the oom group leaf events
test") fixed test_memcg_oom_group_leaf_events() to account for the fact
that the memory.events.oom_kill events in a child cgroup is propagated up
to its parent.  This behavior can actually be configured by the
memory_localevents mount option, so this patch updates the testcase to
properly account for the possible presence of this mount option.
