Subject: mm/vmscan: fix comment for isolate_lru_pages

Since commit 791b48b64232 ("mm: vmscan: scan until it finds eligible
pages"), splicing any skipped pages to the tail of the LRU list won't put
the system at risk of premature OOM but will waste lots of cpu cycles. 
Correct the comment accordingly.
