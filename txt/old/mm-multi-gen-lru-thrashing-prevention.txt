Subject: mm: multi-gen LRU: thrashing prevention

Add /sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/min_ttl_ms for thrashing prevention, as
requested by many desktop users [1].

When set to value N, it prevents the working set of N milliseconds from
getting evicted.  The OOM killer is triggered if this working set cannot
be kept in memory.  Based on the average human detectable lag (~100ms),
N=1000 usually eliminates intolerable lags due to thrashing.  Larger
values like N=3000 make lags less noticeable at the risk of premature OOM
kills.

Compared with the size-based approach, e.g., [2], this time-based approach
has the following advantages:

1. It is easier to configure because it is agnostic to applications
   and memory sizes.
2. It is more reliable because it is directly wired to the OOM killer.
