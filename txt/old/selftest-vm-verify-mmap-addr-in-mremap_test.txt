Subject: selftest/vm: verify mmap addr in mremap_test

Avoid calling mmap with requested addresses that are less than the
system's mmap_min_addr.  When run as root, mmap returns EACCES when trying
to map addresses < mmap_min_addr.  This is not one of the error codes for
the condition to retry the mmap in the test.  Rather than arbitrarily
retrying on EACCES, don't attempt an mmap until addr > vm.mmap_min_addr.

Add a munmap call after an alignment check as the mappings are retained
after the retry and can reach the vm.max_map_count sysctl.
