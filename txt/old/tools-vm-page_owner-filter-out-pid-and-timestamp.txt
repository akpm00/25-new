Subject: tools/vm/page_owner: filter out pid and timestamp

Commit 9cc7e96aa846 ("mm/page_owner: record timestamp and pid") introduces
timestamp and pid for page owner.  However, it is hard to aggregate the
stack since those are specific (especially timestamp).  Filter out those
information when aggregating.
