Subject: sparc/mm: enable ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT

This defines and exports a platform specific custom vm_get_page_prot() via
subscribing ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT.  Subsequently all __SXXX and __PXXX
macros can be dropped which are no longer needed.  This also localizes the
helper arch_vm_get_page_prot() as sparc_vm_get_page_prot() and moves near
vm_get_page_prot().
