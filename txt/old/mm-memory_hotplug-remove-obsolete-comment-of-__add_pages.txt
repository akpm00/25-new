Subject: mm/memory_hotplug: remove obsolete comment of __add_pages

Patch series "A few cleanup patches around memory_hotplug".

This series contains a few patches to fix obsolete and misplaced comments,
clean up the try_offline_node function and so on.  


This patch (of 4):

Since commit f1dd2cd13c4b ("mm, memory_hotplug: do not associate hotadded
memory to zones until online"), there is no need to pass in the zone.

[akpm@linux-foundation.org: remove the comment altogether, per David]
