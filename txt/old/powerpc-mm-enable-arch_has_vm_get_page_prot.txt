Subject: powerpc/mm: enable ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT

This defines and exports a platform specific custom vm_get_page_prot() via
subscribing ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT.  Subsequently all __SXXX and __PXXX
macros can be dropped which are no longer needed.  While here, this also
localizes arch_vm_get_page_prot() as powerpc_vm_get_page_prot() and moves
it near vm_get_page_prot().
