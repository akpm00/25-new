Subject: scripts/checkpatch.pl: remove _deferred and _deferred_once false warning

With commit 98e35f5894cf ("printk: git rid of [sched_delayed] message for
printk_deferred") printk_deferred and printk_deferred_once requires
LOGLEVEL in argument, but checkpatch.pl was not fixed and still reports it
as warning:

WARNING: Possible unnecessary KERN_ALERT
printk_deferred(KERN_ALERT "checking deferred\n");
