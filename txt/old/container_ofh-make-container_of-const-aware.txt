Subject: container_of.h: make container_of const-aware

container_of() macro has one major drawback.  It does not check whether
the passed ptr has a const pointer, the result will always be a non-const
pointer.  Use a _Generic() construct (supported since gcc 4.9 and Clang
3.0) to teach container_of that if converting a const pointer, the
returned pointer should also have the const modifier.
