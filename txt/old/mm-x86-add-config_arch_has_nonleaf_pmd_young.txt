Subject: mm: x86: add CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_NONLEAF_PMD_YOUNG

Some architectures support the accessed bit in non-leaf PMD entries, e.g.,
x86 sets the accessed bit in a non-leaf PMD entry when using it as part of
linear address translation [1].  Page table walkers that clear the
accessed bit may use this capability to reduce their search space.

Note that:
1. Although an inline function is preferable, this capability is added
   as a configuration option for consistency with the existing macros.
2. Due to the little interest in other varieties, this capability was
   only tested on Intel and AMD CPUs.
