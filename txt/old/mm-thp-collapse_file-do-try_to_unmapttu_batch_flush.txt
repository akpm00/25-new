Subject: mm/thp: collapse_file() do try_to_unmap(TTU_BATCH_FLUSH)

collapse_file() is using unmap_mapping_pages(1) on each small page found
mapped, unlike others (reclaim, migration, splitting, memory-failure) who
use try_to_unmap().  There are four advantages to try_to_unmap(): first,
its TTU_IGNORE_MLOCK option now avoids leaving mlocked page in pagevec;
second, its vma lookup uses i_mmap_lock_read() not i_mmap_lock_write();
third, it breaks out early if page is not mapped everywhere it might be;
fourth, its TTU_BATCH_FLUSH option can be used, as in page reclaim, to
save up all the TLB flushing until all of the pages have been unmapped.

Wild guess: perhaps it was originally written to use try_to_unmap(), but
hit the VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_mapped) after unmapping, because without
TTU_SYNC it may skip page table locks; but unmap_mapping_pages() never
skips them, so fixed the issue.  I did once hit that VM_BUG_ON_PAGE()
since making this change: we could pass TTU_SYNC here, but I think just
delete the check - the race is very rare, this is an ordinary small page
so we don't need to be so paranoid about mapcount surprises, and the
page_ref_freeze() just below already handles the case adequately.
