Subject: mm/gup: migrate device coherent pages when pinning instead of failing

Currently any attempts to pin a device coherent page will fail.  This is
because device coherent pages need to be managed by a device driver, and
pinning them would prevent a driver from migrating them off the device.

However this is no reason to fail pinning of these pages.  These are
coherent and accessible from the CPU so can be migrated just like pinning
ZONE_MOVABLE pages.  So instead of failing all attempts to pin them first
try migrating them out of ZONE_DEVICE.

[hch@lst.de: rebased to the split device memory checks, moved migrate_device_page to migrate_device.c]
