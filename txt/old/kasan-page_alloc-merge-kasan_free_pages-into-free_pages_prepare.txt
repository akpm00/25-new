Subject: kasan, page_alloc: merge kasan_free_pages into free_pages_prepare

Currently, the code responsible for initializing and poisoning memory in
free_pages_prepare() is scattered across two locations: kasan_free_pages()
for HW_TAGS KASAN and free_pages_prepare() itself.  This is confusing.

This and a few following patches combine the code from these two
locations.  Along the way, these patches also simplify the performed
checks to make them easier to follow.

Replaces the only caller of kasan_free_pages() with its implementation.

As kasan_has_integrated_init() is only true when CONFIG_KASAN_HW_TAGS is
enabled, moving the code does no functional changes.

This patch is not useful by itself but makes the simplifications in the
following patches easier to follow.
