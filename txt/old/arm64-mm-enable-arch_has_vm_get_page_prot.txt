Subject: arm64/mm: enable ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT

This defines and exports a platform specific custom vm_get_page_prot() via
subscribing ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT.  Subsequently all __SXXX and __PXXX
macros can be dropped which are no longer needed.  This also localizes
both arch_filter_pgprot and arch_vm_get_page_prot() helpers, unsubscribing
from ARCH_HAS_FILTER_PGPROT as well.  Moved both these localized functions
near vm_get_page_prot().
