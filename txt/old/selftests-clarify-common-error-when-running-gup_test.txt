Subject: selftests: clarify common error when running gup_test

The gup_test binary will fail showing only the output of perror("open") in
the case that /sys/kernel/debug/gup_test is not found. This will almost
always be due to CONFIG_GUP_TEST not being set, which enables
compilation of a kernel that provides this file.

Add a short error message to clarify this failure and point the user to
the solution.
