Subject: mm/writeback: minor clean up for highmem_dirtyable_memory

Since commit a804552b9a15 ("mm/page-writeback.c: fix dirty_balance_reserve
subtraction from dirtyable memory"), local variable x can not be negative.
And it can not overflow when it is the total number of dirtyable highmem
pages.  Thus remove the unneeded comment and overflow check.
