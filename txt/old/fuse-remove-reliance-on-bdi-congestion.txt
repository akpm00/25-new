Subject: fuse: remove reliance on bdi congestion

The bdi congestion tracking in not widely used and will be removed.

Fuse is one of a small number of filesystems that uses it, setting both
the sync (read) and async (write) congestion flags at what it determines
are appropriate times.

The only remaining effect of the sync flag is to cause read-ahead to be
skipped.  The only remaining effect of the async flag is to cause (some)
WB_SYNC_NONE writes to be skipped.

So instead of setting the flags, change:
 - .readahead to stop when it has submitted all non-async pages
    for read.
 - .writepages to do nothing if WB_SYNC_NONE and the flag would be set
 - .writepage to return AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE if WB_SYNC_NONE
    and the flag would be set.

The writepages change causes a behavioural change in that pageout() can
now return PAGE_ACTIVATE instead of PAGE_KEEP, so SetPageActive() will be
called on the page which (I think) will further delay the next attempt at
writeout.  This might be a good thing.
