Subject: mm/memory-failure: add new memory failure message MF_MSG_HUGE_ZERO

Memory failure just gets ignored for global huge_zero_page even without a
split attempt.  But corresponding memory failure message
MF_MSG_UNSPLIT_THP is misleading as if the THP page could not be split
during memory failure handling.  This adds a new message MF_MSG_HUGE_ZERO
indicating that memory got ignored for being a huge zero page.
