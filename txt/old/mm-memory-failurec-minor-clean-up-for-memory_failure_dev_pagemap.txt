Subject: mm/memory-failure.c: minor clean up for memory_failure_dev_pagemap

Patch series "A few cleanup and fixup patches for memory failure", v2.

This series contains a few patches to simplify the code logic, remove
unneeded variable and remove obsolete comment.  Also we fix race changing
page more robustly in memory_failure.  More details can be found in the
respective changelogs.


This patch (of 8):

The flags always has MF_ACTION_REQUIRED and MF_MUST_KILL set.  So we do
not need to check these flags again.
