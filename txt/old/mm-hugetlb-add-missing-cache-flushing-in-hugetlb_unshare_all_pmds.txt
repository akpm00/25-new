Subject: mm: hugetlb: add missing cache flushing in hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds()

Missed calling flush_cache_range() before removing the sharing PMD
entrires, otherwise data consistence issue may be occurred on some
architectures whose caches are strict and require a virtual>physical
translation to exist for a virtual address.  Thus add it.

Now no architectures enabling PMD sharing will be affected, since they do
not have a VIVT cache.  That means this issue can not be happened in
practice so far.
