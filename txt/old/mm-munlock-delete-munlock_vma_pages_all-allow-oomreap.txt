Subject: mm/munlock: delete munlock_vma_pages_all(), allow oomreap

munlock_vma_pages_range() will still be required, when munlocking but not
munmapping a set of pages; but when unmapping a pte, the mlock count will
be maintained in much the same way as it will be maintained when mapping
in the pte.  Which removes the need for munlock_vma_pages_all() on mlocked
vmas when munmapping or exiting: eliminating the catastrophic contention
on i_mmap_rwsem, and the need for page lock on the pages.

There is still a need to update locked_vm accounting according to the
munmapped vmas when munmapping: do that in detach_vmas_to_be_unmapped(). 
exit_mmap() does not need locked_vm updates, so delete unlock_range().

And wasn't I the one who forbade the OOM reaper to attack mlocked vmas,
because of the uncertainty in blocking on all those page locks?  No fear
of that now, so permit the OOM reaper on mlocked vmas.
