Subject: vmcore: convert copy_oldmem_page() to take an iov_iter

Patch series "Convert vmcore to use an iov_iter", v5.

For some reason several people have been sending bad patches to fix
compiler warnings in vmcore recently.  Here's how it should be done. 
Compile-tested only on x86.  As noted in the first patch, s390 should take
this conversion a bit further, but I'm not inclined to do that work
myself.


This patch (of 3):

Instead of passing in a 'buf' and 'userbuf' argument, pass in an iov_iter.
s390 needs more work to pass the iov_iter down further, or refactor, but
I'd be more comfortable if someone who can test on s390 did that work.

It's more convenient to convert the whole of read_from_oldmem() to take an
iov_iter at the same time, so rename it to read_from_oldmem_iter() and add
a temporary read_from_oldmem() wrapper that creates an iov_iter.
