Subject: shmem: convert shmem_alloc_hugepage() to use vma_alloc_folio()

Patch series "Folio patches for 5.19".

 - Finish the conversion from alloc_pages_vma() to vma_alloc_folio()
 - Finish converting shrink_page_list() to folios
 - Start converting shmem from pages to folios (alas, not finished,
   I have simply run out of time with all the debugging/fixing needed
   for 5.18)


This patch (of 21):

For now, return the head page of the folio, but remove use of the old
alloc_pages_vma() API.
