Subject: lib/string.c: simplify str[c]spn

Use strchr(), which makes them a lot shorter, and more obviously symmetric
in their treatment of accept/reject.  It also saves a little bit of .text;
bloat-o-meter for an arm build says

Function                                     old     new   delta
strcspn                                       92      76     -16
strspn                                       108      76     -32

While here, also remove a stray empty line before EXPORT_SYMBOL().
