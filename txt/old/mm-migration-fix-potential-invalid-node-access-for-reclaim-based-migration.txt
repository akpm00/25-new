Subject: mm/migration: fix potential invalid node access for reclaim-based migration

If we failed to setup hotplug state callbacks for mm/demotion:online in
some corner cases, node_demotion will be left uninitialized.  Invalid node
might be returned from the next_demotion_node() when doing reclaim-based
migration.  Use kcalloc to allocate node_demotion to fix the issue.
