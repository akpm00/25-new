Subject: mm/page_alloc: do not calculate node's total pages and memmap pages when empty

Patch series "A minor hotplug refactoring".


This patch (of 3):

free_area_init_node() calls calculate_node_totalpages() and
free_area_init_core().  The former to get node's {spanned,present}_pages,
and the latter to calculate, among other things, how many pages per zone
we spent on memmap_pages, which is used to subtract zone's free pages.

On memoryless nodes, it is pointless to perform such a bunch of work, so
make sure we skip the calculations when having a node or empty zone.
