Subject: mm/balloon_compaction: make balloon page compaction callbacks static

Since commit b1123ea6d3b3 ("mm: balloon: use general non-lru movable page
feature"), these functions are called via balloon_aops callbacks.  They're
not called directly outside this file.  So make them static and clean up
the relevant code.
