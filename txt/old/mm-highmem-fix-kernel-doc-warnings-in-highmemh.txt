Subject: mm/highmem: fix kernel-doc warnings in highmem*.h

`scripts/kernel-doc -none include/linux/highmem*` reports the following
warnings:

include/linux/highmem.h:160: warning: expecting prototype for kunmap_atomic(). Prototype was for nr_free_highpages() instead
include/linux/highmem-internal.h:256: warning: Function parameter or member '__addr' not described in 'kunmap_atomic'
include/linux/highmem-internal.h:256: warning: Excess function parameter 'addr' description in 'kunmap_atomic'

Fix these warnings by (1) move the kernel-doc comments from highmem.h to
highmem-internal.h (which is the file were the kunmap_atomic() macro is
actually defined), (2) merge it with the comment which already was in
highmem-internal.h, and (3) use correct parameter names.
