Subject: mm/damon/sysfs: add a file for listing available monitoring ops

DAMON programming interface users can know if specific monitoring ops set
is registered or not using 'damon_is_registered_ops()', but there is no
such method for the user space.  To help the case, this commit adds a new
DAMON sysfs file called 'avail_operations' under each context directory
for listing available monitoring ops.  Reading the file will list each
registered monitoring ops on each line.
