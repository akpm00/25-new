Subject: mm/mlock: fix two bugs in user_shm_lock()

user_shm_lock forgets to set allowed to 0 when get_ucounts fails.  So the
later user_shm_unlock might do the extra dec_rlimit_ucounts.  Also in the
RLIM_INFINITY case, user_shm_lock will success regardless of the value of
memlock where memblock == LONG_MAX && !capable(CAP_IPC_LOCK) should fail. 
Fix all of these by changing the code to leave lock_limit at ULONG_MAX aka
RLIM_INFINITY, leave "allowed" initialized to 0 and remove the special
case of RLIM_INFINITY as nothing can be greater than ULONG_MAX.

Credit goes to Eric W.  Biederman for proposing simplifying the code and
thus catching the later bug.
