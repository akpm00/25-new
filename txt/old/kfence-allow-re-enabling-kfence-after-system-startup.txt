Subject: kfence: allow re-enabling KFENCE after system startup

Patch series "provide the flexibility to enable KFENCE", v2.


This patch (of 2):

If once KFENCE is disabled by:
echo 0 > /sys/module/kfence/parameters/sample_interval
KFENCE could never be re-enabled until next rebooting.

Allow re-enabling it by writing a positive num to sample_interval.
