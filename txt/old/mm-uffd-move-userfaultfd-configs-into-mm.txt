Subject: mm/uffd: move USERFAULTFD configs into mm/

We used to have USERFAULTFD configs stored in init/.  It makes sense as a
start because that's the default place for storing syscall related
configs.

However userfaultfd evolved a bit in the past few years and some more
config options were added.  They're no longer related to syscalls and
start to be not suitable to be kept in the init/ directory anymore,
because they're pure mm concepts.

But it's not ideal either to keep the userfaultfd configs separate from
each other.  Hence this patch moves the userfaultfd configs under init/ to
be under mm/ so that we'll start to group all userfaultfd configs
together.

We do have quite a few examples of syscall related configs that are not
put under init/Kconfig: FTRACE_SYSCALLS, SWAP, FILE_LOCKING,
MEMFD_CREATE..  They all reside in the dir where they're more suitable for
the concept.  So it seems there's no restriction to keep the role of
having syscall related CONFIG_* under init/ only.
