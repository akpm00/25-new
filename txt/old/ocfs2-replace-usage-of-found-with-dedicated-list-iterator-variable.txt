Subject: ocfs2: replace usage of found with dedicated list iterator variable

To move the list iterator variable into the list_for_each_entry_*() macro
in the future it should be avoided to use the list iterator variable after
the loop body.

To *never* use the list iterator variable after the loop it was concluded
to use a separate iterator variable instead of a found boolean [1].

This removes the need to use a found variable and simply checking if the
variable was set, can determine if the break/goto was hit.
