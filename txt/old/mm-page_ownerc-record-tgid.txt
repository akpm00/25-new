Subject: mm/page_owner.c: record tgid

In a single-threaded process, the pid in kernel task_struct is the same as
the tgid, which can mark the process of page allocation.  But in a
multithreaded process, only the task_struct of the thread leader has the
same pid as tgid, and the pids of other threads are different from tgid. 
Therefore, tgid is recorded to provide effective information for debugging
and data statistics of multithreaded programs.

This can also be achieved by observing the task name (executable file
name) for a specific process.  However, when the same program is started
multiple times, the task name is the same and the tgid is different. 
Therefore, in the debugging of multi-threaded programs, combined with the
task name and tgid, more accurate runtime information of a certain run of
the program can be obtained.
