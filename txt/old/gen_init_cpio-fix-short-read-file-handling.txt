Subject: gen_init_cpio: fix short read file handling

When processing a "file" entry, gen_init_cpio attempts to allocate a
buffer large enough to stage the entire contents of the source file.  It
then attempts to fill the buffer via a single read() call and subsequently
writes out the entire buffer length, without checking that read() returned
the full length, potentially writing uninitialized buffer memory.

Fix this by breaking up file I/O into 64k chunks and only writing the
length returned by the prior read() call.
