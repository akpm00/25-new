Subject: hugetlb: fix wrong use of nr_online_nodes

Patch series "hugetlb: Fix some incorrect behavior", v3.

This series fix three bugs of hugetlb:
1) Invalid use of nr_online_nodes;
2) Inconsistency between 1G hugepage and 2M hugepage;
3) Useless information in dmesg.


This patch (of 4):

Certain systems are designed to have sparse/discontiguous nodes.  In this
case, nr_online_nodes can not be used to walk through numa node.  Also, a
valid node may be greater than nr_online_nodes.

However, in hugetlb, it is assumed that nodes are contiguous.

For sparse/discontiguous nodes, the current code may treat a valid node
as invalid, and will fail to allocate all hugepages on a valid node that
"nid >= nr_online_nodes".

As David suggested:

	if (tmp >= nr_online_nodes)
		goto invalid;

Just imagine node 0 and node 2 are online, and node 1 is offline. 
Assuming that "node < 2" is valid is wrong.  

Recheck all the places that use nr_online_nodes, and repair them one by
one.
