Subject: mm/memory-failure.c: avoid false-postive PageSwapCache test

Patch series "A few fixup and cleanup patches for memory failure".

This series contains a patch to fix false-postive PageSwapCache test,
minor cleanup for HWPoisonHandlable and try to dissolve truncated hugetlb
page.  More details can be found in the respective changelogs.


This patch (of 3):

PageSwapCache is only reliable when PageAnon is true because
PG_swapcache serves as PG_owner_priv_1 which can be used by fs if it's
pagecache page.  So we should test PageAnon() to distinguish pagecache
pages from anonymous pages.
