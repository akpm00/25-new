Subject: mm/munlock: remove fields to fix htmldocs warnings

Stephen reports that 'make htmldocs' currently issues two warnings:

include/linux/mm_types.h:275: warning: Function parameter or member
'__filler' not described in 'folio'
include/linux/mm_types.h:275: warning: Function parameter or member
'mlock_count' not described in 'folio'

Certainly __filler doesn't want documenting there, and all but one use of
mlock_count is through page->mlock_count at present: so I think it's best
just to remove them both from struct folio for now, and sort out the right
way to document folio->mlock_count once that is the one true way.
