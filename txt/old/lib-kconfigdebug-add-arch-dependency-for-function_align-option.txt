Subject: lib/Kconfig.debug: add ARCH dependency for FUNCTION_ALIGN option

0Day robots reported there is compiling issue for 'csky' ARCH
when CONFIG_DEBUG_FORCE_DATA_SECTION_ALIGNED is enabled [1]:

All errors (new ones prefixed by >>):

   {standard input}: Assembler messages:
>> {standard input}:2277: Error: pcrel offset for branch to .LS000B too far (0x3c)


Which was discussed in [2].  And as there is no solution for csky yet, add
some dependency for this config to limit it to several ARCHs which have no
compiling issue so far.
