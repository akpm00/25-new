Subject: mm/z3fold: declare z3fold_mount with __init

Patch series "A few cleanup patches for z3fold", v2.

This series contains a few patches to simplify the code, remove unneeded
code, fix obsolete comment and so on.  More details can be found in the
respective changelogs.


This patch (of 8):

z3fold_mount is only called during init.  So we should declare it with
__init.
