Subject: mm: move responsibility for setting SWP_FS_OPS to ->swap_activate

If a filesystem wishes to handle all swap IO itself (via ->direct_IO and
->readpage), rather than just providing devices addresses for
submit_bio(), SWP_FS_OPS must be set.

Currently the protocol for setting this it to have ->swap_activate return
zero.  In that case SWP_FS_OPS is set, and add_swap_extent() is called for
the entire file.

This is a little clumsy as different return values for ->swap_activate
have quite different meanings, and it makes it hard to search for which
filesystems require SWP_FS_OPS to be set.

So remove the special meaning of a zero return, and require the filesystem
to set SWP_FS_OPS if it so desires, and to always call add_swap_extent()
as required.

Currently only NFS and CIFS return zero for add_swap_extent().
