Subject: tools/vm/page_owner_sort.c: support sorting by tgid and update documentation

When the "page owner" information is read, the information sorted
by TGID is expected.

As a result, the following adjustments have been made:

1. Add a new -P option to sort the information of blocks by TGID in
   ascending order.

2. Adjust the order of member variables in block_list strust to avoid
   one 4 byte hole.

3. Add -P option explanation in the document.
