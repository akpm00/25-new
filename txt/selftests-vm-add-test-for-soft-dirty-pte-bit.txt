Subject: selftests: vm: add test for Soft-Dirty PTE bit

This introduces three tests:

1) Sanity check soft dirty basic semantics: allocate area, clean,
   dirty, check if the SD bit is flipped.

2) Check VMA reuse: validate the VM_SOFTDIRTY usage

3) Check soft-dirty on huge pages

This was motivated by Will Deacon's fix commit 912efa17e512 ("mm: proc:
Invalidate TLB after clearing soft-dirty page state").  I was tracking the
same issue that he fixed, and this test would have caught it.
