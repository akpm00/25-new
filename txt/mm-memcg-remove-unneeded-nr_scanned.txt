Subject: mm/memcg: remove unneeded nr_scanned

The local variable nr_scanned is unneeded as mem_cgroup_soft_reclaim
always does *total_scanned += nr_scanned.  So we can pass total_scanned
directly to the mem_cgroup_soft_reclaim to simplify the code and save some
cpu cycles of adding nr_scanned to total_scanned.
