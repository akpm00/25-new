Subject: fat: remove time truncations in vfat_create/vfat_mkdir
Date: Tue, 3 May 2022 23:25:36 +0800

All the timestamps in vfat_create() and vfat_mkdir() come from
fat_time_fat2unix() which ensures time granularity.  We don't need to
truncate them to fit FAT's format.

Moreover, fat_truncate_crtime() and fat_timespec64_trunc_10ms() are also
removed because there is no caller anymore.
