Subject: mmap: Change zeroing of maple tree in __vma_adjust()

Only write to the maple tree if we are not inserting or the insert isn't
going to overwrite the area to clear.  This avoids spanning writes and
node coealescing when unnecessary.

The change requires a custom search for the linked list addition to find
the correct VMA for the prev link.
