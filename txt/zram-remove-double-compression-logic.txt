Subject: zram: remove double compression logic

The 2nd trial allocation under per-cpu presumption has been used to
prevent regression of allocation failure.  However, it makes trouble for
maintenance without significant benefit.  The slowpath branch is executed
extremely rarely: getting there is problematic.  Therefore, we delete this
branch.

Since b09ab054b69b ("zram: support BDI_CAP_STABLE_WRITES"), zram has used
QUEUE_FLAG_STABLE_WRITES to prevent buffer change between 1st and 2nd
memory allocations.  Since we remove second trial memory allocation logic,
we could remove the STABLE_WRITES flag because there is no change buffer
to be modified under us.
