Subject: selftest/vm: verify remap destination address in mremap_test

Because mremap does not have a MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE flag, it can destroy
existing mappings.  This causes a segfault when regions such as text are
remapped and the permissions are changed.

Verify the requested mremap destination address does not overlap any
existing mappings by using mmap's MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE flag.  Keep
incrementing the destination address until a valid mapping is found or
fail the current test once the max address is reached.
