Subject: selftest/vm: verify remap destination address in mremap_test

Because mremap does not have a NOREPLACE flag, it can destroy existing
mappings.  This can cause a segfault if regions such as text are
destroyed.  Verify the requested mremap destination address does not
overlap any existing mappings by using mmap's FIXED_NOREPLACE flag and
checking for the EEXIST error code.  Keep incrementing the destination
address until a valid mapping is found or max address is reached.
