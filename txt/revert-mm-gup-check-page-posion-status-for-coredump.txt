Subject: Revert "mm/gup: check page posion status for coredump."

While reviewing
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210429122519.15183-4-david@redhat.com I have
crossed d3378e86d182 ("mm/gup: check page posion status for coredump.")
and noticed that this patch is broken in two ways.  First it doesn't
really prevent hwpoison pages from being dumped because hwpoison pages can
be marked asynchornously at any time after the check.  Secondly, and more
importantly, the patch introduces a ref count leak because get_dump_page
takes a reference on the page which is not released.

It also seems that the patch was merged incorrectly because there were
follow up changes not included as well as discussions on how to address
the underlying problem
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/57ac524c-b49a-99ec-c1e4-ef5027bfb61b@redhat.com

Therefore revert the original patch.
