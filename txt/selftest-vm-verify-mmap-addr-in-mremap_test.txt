Subject: selftest/vm: verify mmap addr in mremap_test

Patch series "selftest/vm fix segfault in mremap_test".


Avoid calling mmap with requested addresses that are less than the
system's mmap_min_addr.  Running the test as root returns EACCES when
trying to map addresses < mmap_min_addr which is not one of the error
codes for the retry condition.  Add a munmap call after an alignment check
as the mappings are retained after the retry and can reach
vm.max_map_count.
