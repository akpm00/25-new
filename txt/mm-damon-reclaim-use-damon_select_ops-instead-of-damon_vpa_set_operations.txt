Subject: mm/damon/reclaim: use damon_select_ops() instead of damon_{v,p}a_set_operations()

This commit makes DAMON_RECLAIM to select the registered monitoring
operations for the physical address space instead of setting it on its
own.  This allows DAMON_RECLAIM be independent of DAMON_PADDR, but leave
the dependency as is, because it's the only one monitoring operations it
use, and therefore it makes no sense to build DAMON_RECLAIM without
DAMON_PADDR.
