Subject: mm/mmap: clarify protection_map[] indices

protection_map[] maps vm_flags access combinations into page protection
value as defined by the platform via __PXXX and __SXXX macros.  The array
indices in protection_map[], represents vm_flags access combinations but
it's not very intuitive to derive.  This makes it clear and explicit.
