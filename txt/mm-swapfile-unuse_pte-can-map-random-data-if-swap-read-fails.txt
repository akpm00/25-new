Subject: mm/swapfile: unuse_pte can map random data if swap read fails

There is a bug in unuse_pte(): when swap page happens to be unreadable,
page filled with random data is mapped into user address space.  In case
of error, a special swap entry indicating swap read fails is set to the
page table.  So the swapcache page can be freed and the user won't end up
with a permanently mounted swap because a sector is bad.  And if the page
is accessed later, the user process will be killed so that corrupted data
is never consumed.  On the other hand, if the page is never accessed, the
user won't even notice it.
