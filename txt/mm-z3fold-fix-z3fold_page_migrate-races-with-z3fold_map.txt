Subject: mm/z3fold: fix z3fold_page_migrate races with z3fold_map

Think about the below scenario:

CPU1				CPU2
 z3fold_page_migrate		z3fold_map
  z3fold_page_trylock
  ...
  z3fold_page_unlock
  /* slots still points to old zhdr*/
				 get_z3fold_header
				  get slots from handle
				  get old zhdr from slots
				  z3fold_page_trylock
				  return *old* zhdr
  encode_handle(new_zhdr, FIRST|LAST|MIDDLE)
  put_page(page) /* zhdr is freed! */
				 but zhdr is still used by caller!

z3fold_map can map freed z3fold page and lead to use-after-free bug.  To
fix it, we add PAGE_MIGRATED to indicate z3fold page is migrated and soon
to be released.  So get_z3fold_header won't return such page.
