Subject: mm: hugetlb_vmemmap: cleanup hugetlb_vmemmap related functions

Patch series "cleanup hugetlb_vmemmap".

The word of "free" is not expressive enough to express the feature of
optimizing vmemmap pages associated with each HugeTLB, rename this keywork
to "optimize" is more clear.  In this series, cheanup related codes to
make it more clear and expressive.  This is suggested by David.


This patch (of 3):

The word of "free" is not expressive enough to express the feature of
optimizing vmemmap pages associated with each HugeTLB, rename this keywork
to "optimize".  And some function names are prefixed with "huge_page"
instead of "hugetlb", it is easily to be confused with THP.  In this
patch, cheanup related functions to make code more clear and expressive.
