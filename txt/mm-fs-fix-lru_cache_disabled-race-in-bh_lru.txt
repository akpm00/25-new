Subject: mm: fs: fix lru_cache_disabled race in bh_lru

Check lru_cache_disabled under bh_lru_lock.  Otherwise, it could introduce
race below and it fails to migrate pages containing buffer_head.

   CPU 0					CPU 1

bh_lru_install
                                       lru_cache_disable
  lru_cache_disabled = false
                                       atomic_inc(&lru_disable_count);
				       invalidate_bh_lrus_cpu of CPU 0
				       bh_lru_lock
				       __invalidate_bh_lrus
				       bh_lru_unlock
  bh_lru_lock
  install the bh
  bh_lru_unlock

WHen this race happens a CMA allocation fails, which is critical for
the workload which depends on CMA.
