Subject: mm: zswap: add basic meminfo and vmstat coverage

Currently it requires poking at debugfs to figure out the size and
population of the zswap cache on a host.  There are no counters for reads
and writes against the cache.  As a result, it's difficult to understand
zswap behavior on production systems.

Print zswap memory consumption and how many pages are zswapped out in
/proc/meminfo.  Count zswapouts and zswapins in /proc/vmstat.
