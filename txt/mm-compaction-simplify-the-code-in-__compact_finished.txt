Subject: mm: compaction: simplify the code in __compact_finished

Since commit efe771c7603b ("mm, compaction: always finish scanning of a
full pageblock"), compaction will always finish scanning a pageblock.  And
migrate_pfn is assured to align with pageblock_nr_pages when we reach
here.  So we will always return COMPACT_SUCCESS if a suitable fallback is
found due to the below IS_ALIGNED check of migrate_pfn.  Simplify the code
to make this clear and improve the readability.  No functional change
intended.
