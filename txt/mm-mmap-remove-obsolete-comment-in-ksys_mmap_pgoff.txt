Subject: mm/mmap: remove obsolete comment in ksys_mmap_pgoff

RLIMIT_MEMLOCK is already reimplemented on top of ucounts now.  And since
commit 83c1fd763b32 ("mm,hugetlb: remove mlock ulimit for SHM_HUGETLB"),
mlock ulimit for SHM_HUGETLB is further removed.  So we should remove this
obsolete comment.
