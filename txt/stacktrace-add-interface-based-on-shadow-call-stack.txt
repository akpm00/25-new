Subject: stacktrace: add interface based on shadow call stack

Patch series "kasan, arm64, scs, stacktrace: collect stack traces from Shadow Call Stack", v2.

Currently, KASAN always uses the normal stack trace collection routines,
which rely on the unwinder, when saving alloc and free stack traces.

Instead of invoking the unwinder, collect the stack trace by copying
frames from the Shadow Call Stack whenever it is enabled.  This reduces
boot time by 30% for all KASAN modes when Shadow Call Stack is enabled.

Stack staces are collected from the Shadow Call Stack via a new
stack_trace_save_shadow() interface.

Note that the frame of the interrupted function is not included into the
stack trace, as it is not yet saved on the SCS when an interrupt happens.


This patch (of 4):

Add a new interface stack_trace_save_shadow() for collecting stack traces
by copying frames from the Shadow Call Stack.

Collecting stack traces this way is significantly faster: boot time of a
defconfig build with KASAN enabled gets descreased by ~30%.

The few patches following this one add an implementation of
stack_trace_save_shadow() for arm64.

The implementation of the added interface is not meant to use
stack_trace_consume_fn to avoid making a function call for each collected
frame to further improve performance.
