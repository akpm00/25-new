Subject: Docs/vm/damon/design: update DAMON-Idle Page Tracking interference handling

In DAMON's early development stage before it be merged in the mainline, it
was first designed to work exclusively with Idle page tracking to avoid
any interference between each other.  Later, but still before be merged in
the mainline, because Idle page tracking is fully under the control of
sysadmins, we made the resolving of conflict as the responsibility of
sysadmins.  The document is not updated for the change, though.  This
commit updates the document for that.
