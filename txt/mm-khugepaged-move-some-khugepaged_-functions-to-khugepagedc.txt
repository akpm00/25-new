Subject: mm: khugepaged: move some khugepaged_* functions to khugepaged.c

To reuse hugepage_vma_check() for khugepaged_enter() so that we could
remove some duplicate code.  But moving hugepage_vma_check() to
khugepaged.h needs to include huge_mm.h in it, it seems not optimal to
bloat khugepaged.h.

And the khugepaged_* functions actually are wrappers for some non-inline
functions, so it seems the benefits are not too much to keep them inline.

So move the khugepaged_* functions to khugepaged.c, any callers just need
to include khugepaged.h which is quite small.  For example, the following
patches will call khugepaged_enter() in filemap page fault path for
regular filesystems to make readonly FS THP collapse more consistent.  The
filemap.c just needs to include khugepaged.h.
