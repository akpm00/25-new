Subject: h8300: rearrange headers inclusion order in asm/bitops

The commit a5145bdad3ff ("arch: rearrange headers inclusion order in
asm/bitops for m68k and sh") on next-20210401 fixed header ordering issue.
h8300 has similar problem, which was overlooked by me.

h8300 includes bitmap/{find,le}.h prior to ffs/fls headers. New fast-path
implementation in find.h requires ffs/fls. Reordering the headers inclusion
sequence helps to prevent compile-time implicit function declaration error.

v2: change wording in the comment.
