Subject: mm: Optimize find_exact_vma() to use vma_lookup()

From: "Liam R. Howlett" <Liam.Howlett@Oracle.com>

Use vma_lookup() to walk the tree to the start value requested.  If
the vma at the start does not match, then the answer is NULL and there
is no need to look at the next vma the way that find_vma() would.
