Subject: mm/migration: return errno when isolate_huge_page failed

We might fail to isolate huge page due to e.g.  the page is under
migration which cleared HPageMigratable.  So we should return -EBUSY in
this case rather than always return 1 which could confuse the user.  Also
we make the prototype of isolate_huge_page consistent with
isolate_lru_page to improve the readability.
