Subject: mm: don't skip swap entry even if zap_details specified

Patch series "mm: Rework zap ptes on swap entries", v5.

Patch 1 should fix a long standing bug for zap_pte_range() on zap_details
usage.  The risk is we could have some swap entries skipped while we should
have zapped them.

Migration entries are not the major concern because file backed memory always
zap in the pattern that "first time without page lock, then re-zap with page
lock" hence the 2nd zap will always make sure all migration entries are already
recovered.

However there can be issues with real swap entries got skipped errornoously.
There's a reproducer provided in commit message of patch 1 for that.

Patch 2-4 are cleanups that are based on patch 1.  After the whole patchset
applied, we should have a very clean view of zap_pte_range().

Only patch 1 needs to be backported to stable if necessary.


This patch (of 4):

The "details" pointer shouldn't be the token to decide whether we should
skip swap entries.

For example, when the callers specified details->zap_mapping==NULL, it
means the user wants to zap all the pages (including COWed pages), then we
need to look into swap entries because there can be private COWed pages
that was swapped out.

Skipping some swap entries when details is non-NULL may lead to wrongly
leaving some of the swap entries while we should have zapped them.

A reproducer of the problem:

We don't need to touch up the pmd path, because pmd never had a issue with
swap entries.  For example, shmem pmd migration will always be split into
pte level, and same to swapping on anonymous.

Add another helper should_zap_cows() so that we can also check whether we
should zap private mappings when there's no page pointer specified.

This patch drops that trick, so we handle swap ptes coherently.  Meanwhile
we should do the same check upon migration entry, hwpoison entry and
genuine swap entries too.

To be explicit, we should still remember to keep the private entries if
even_cows==false, and always zap them when even_cows==true.

The issue seems to exist starting from the initial commit of git.
