Subject: mm/hwpoison: put page in already hwpoisoned case with MF_COUNT_INCREASED

In already hwpoisoned case, memory_failure() is supposed to return with
releasing the page refcount taken for error handling.  But currently the
refcount is not released when called with MF_COUNT_INCREASED, which makes
page refcount inconsistent.  This should be rare and non-critical, but it
might be inconvenient in testing (unpoison doesn't work).
