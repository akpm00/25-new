Subject: block: restore /proc/partitions to not display non-partitionable removable devices

We found with newer kernels we started seeing the cdrom device showing
up in /proc/partitions, but it was not there before.

Looking into this I found that commit d27769ec ("block: add
GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN") introduces this change in behavior.  It's not
clear to me from the commit's changelog if this change was intentional or
not.  This comment still remains: /* Don't show non-partitionable
removeable devices or empty devices */ so I've decided to send a patch to
restore the behavior of not printing unpartitionable removable devices.
