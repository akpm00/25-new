Subject: hugetlb: do not demote poisoned hugetlb pages

It is possible for poisoned hugetlb pages to reside on the free lists. 
The huge page allocation routines which dequeue entries from the free
lists make a point of avoiding poisoned pages.  There is no such check and
avoidance in the demote code path.

If a hugetlb page on the is on a free list, poison will only be set in the
head page rather then the page with the actual error.  If such a page is
demoted, then the poison flag may follow the wrong page.  A page without
error could have poison set, and a page with poison could not have the
flag set.

Check for poison before attempting to demote a hugetlb page.  Also, return
-EBUSY to the caller if only poisoned pages are on the free list.
