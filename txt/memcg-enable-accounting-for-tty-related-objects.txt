Subject: memcg: enable accounting for tty-related objects

At each login the user forces the kernel to create a new terminal and
allocate up to ~1Kb memory for the tty-related structures.

By default it's allowed to create up to 4096 ptys with 1024 reserve for
initial mount namespace only and the settings are controlled by host
admin.

Though this default is not enough for hosters with thousands of containers
per node.  Host admin can be forced to increase it up to NR_UNIX98_PTY_MAX
= 1<<20.

By default container is restricted by pty mount_opt.max = 1024, but admin
inside container can change it via remount.  As a result, one container
can consume almost all allowed ptys and allocate up to 1Gb of unaccounted
memory.

It is not enough per-se to trigger OOM on host, however anyway, it allows
to significantly exceed the assigned memcg limit and leads to troubles on
the over-committed node.

It makes sense to account for them to restrict the host's memory
consumption from inside the memcg-limited container.
