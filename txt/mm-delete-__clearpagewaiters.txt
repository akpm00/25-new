Subject: mm: delete __ClearPageWaiters()

The PG_waiters bit is not included in PAGE_FLAGS_CHECK_AT_FREE, and
vmscan.c's free_unref_page_list() callers rely on that not to generate
bad_page() alerts.  So __page_cache_release(), put_pages_list() and
release_pages() (and presumably copy-and-pasted free_zone_device_page())
are redundant and misleading to make a special point of clearing it (as
the "__" implies, it could only safely be used on the freeing path).

Delete __ClearPageWaiters().  Remark on this in one of the "possible"
comments in folio_wake_bit(), and delete the superfluous comments.
