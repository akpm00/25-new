Subject: minix: fix bug when opening a file with O_DIRECT

Testcase:
1. create a minix file system and mount it
2. open a file on the file system with O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_DIRECT
3. open fails with -EINVAL but leaves an empty file behind. All other
open() failures don't leave the failed open files behind.

It is hard to check the direct_IO op before creating the inode.  Just as
ext4 and btrfs do, this patch will resolve the issue by allowing to create
the file with O_DIRECT but returning error when writing the file.
