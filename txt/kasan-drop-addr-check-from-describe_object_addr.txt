Subject: kasan: drop addr check from describe_object_addr

Patch series "kasan: report clean-ups and improvements".

A number of clean-up patches for KASAN reporting code.  Most are
non-functional and only improve readability.


This patch (of 22):

describe_object_addr() used to be called with NULL addr in the early days
of KASAN.  This no longer happens, so drop the check.
