Subject: mm/migration: remove unneeded local variable mapping_locked

Patch series "A few cleanup and fixup patches for migration", v2.

This series contains a few patches to remove unneeded variables, jump
label and use helper to simplify the code.  Also we fix some bugs such as
page refcounts leak , invalid node access and so on.  More details can be
found in the respective changelogs.


This patch (of 11):

When mapping_locked is true, TTU_RMAP_LOCKED is always set to ttu.  We can
check ttu instead so mapping_locked can be removed.  And ttu is either 0
or TTU_RMAP_LOCKED now.  Change '|=' to '=' to reflect this.
