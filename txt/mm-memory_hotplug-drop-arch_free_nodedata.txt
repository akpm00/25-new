Subject: mm, memory_hotplug: drop arch_free_nodedata

Prior to "mm: handle uninitialized numa nodes gracefully" memory hotplug
used to allocate pgdat when memory has been added to a node
(hotadd_init_pgdat) arch_free_nodedata has been only used in the failure
path because once the pgdat is exported (to be visible by NODA_DATA(nid))
it cannot really be freed because there is no synchronization available
for that.

pgdat is allocated for each possible nodes now so the memory hotplug
doesn't need to do the ever use arch_free_nodedata so drop it.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional change.
