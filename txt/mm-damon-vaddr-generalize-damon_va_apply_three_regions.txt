Subject: mm/damon/vaddr: generalize damon_va_apply_three_regions()

'damon_va_apply_three_regions()' is for adjusting address ranges to fit in
three discontiguous ranges.  The function can be generalized for arbitrary
number of discontiguous ranges and reused for future usage, such as
arbitrary online regions update.  For such future usage, this commit
introduces a generalized version of the function called
'damon_set_regions()'.
