Subject: mm: fix missing handler for __GFP_NOWARN

We expect no warnings to be issued when we specify __GFP_NOWARN, but
currently in paths like alloc_pages() and kmalloc(), there are still some
warnings printed, fix it.

But for some warnings that report usage problems, we don't deal with them.
If such warnings are printed, then we should fix the usage problems. 
Such as the following case:

	WARN_ON_ONCE((gfp_flags & __GFP_NOFAIL) && (order > 1));
