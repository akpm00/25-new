Subject: kasan, page_alloc: deduplicate should_skip_kasan_poison

Patch series "kasan, vmalloc, arm64: add vmalloc tagging support for SW/HW_TAGS", v6.

This patchset adds vmalloc tagging support for SW_TAGS and HW_TAGS
KASAN modes.

About half of patches are cleanups I went for along the way.  None of them
seem to be important enough to go through stable, so I decided not to
split them out into separate patches/series.

The patchset is partially based on an early version of the HW_TAGS
patchset by Vincenzo that had vmalloc support.  Thus, I added a
Co-developed-by tag into a few patches.

SW_TAGS vmalloc tagging support is straightforward.  It reuses all of the
generic KASAN machinery, but uses shadow memory to store tags instead of
magic values.  Naturally, vmalloc tagging requires adding a few
kasan_reset_tag() annotations to the vmalloc code.

HW_TAGS vmalloc tagging support stands out.  HW_TAGS KASAN is based on Arm
MTE, which can only assigns tags to physical memory.  As a result, HW_TAGS
KASAN only tags vmalloc() allocations, which are backed by page_alloc
memory.  It ignores vmap() and others.


This patch (of 39):

Currently, should_skip_kasan_poison() has two definitions: one for when
CONFIG_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT is enabled, one for when it's not.

Instead of duplicating the checks, add a deferred_pages_enabled() helper
and use it in a single should_skip_kasan_poison() definition.

Also move should_skip_kasan_poison() closer to its caller and clarify all
conditions in the comment.
