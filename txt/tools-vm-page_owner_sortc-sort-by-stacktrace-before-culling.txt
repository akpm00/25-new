Subject: tools/vm/page_owner_sort.c: sort by stacktrace before culling

The contents of page_owner have changed to include more information than
the stack trace.  On a modern kernel, the blocks look like

Page allocated via order 0, mask 0x0(), pid 1, ts 165564237 ns, free_ts 0 ns
 register_early_stack+0x4b/0x90
 init_page_owner+0x39/0x250
 kernel_init_freeable+0x11e/0x242
 kernel_init+0x16/0x130

Sorting by the contents of .txt will result in almost no repeated pages,
as the pid, ts, and free_ts will almost never be the same.  Instead, sort
by the contents of the stack trace, which we assume to be whatever is
after the first line.
