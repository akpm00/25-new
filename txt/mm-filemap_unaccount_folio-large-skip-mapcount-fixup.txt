Subject: mm: filemap_unaccount_folio() large skip mapcount fixup

The page_mapcount_reset() when folio_mapped() while mapping_exiting() was
devised long before there were huge or compound pages in the cache.  It is
still valid for small pages, but not at all clear what's right to check
and reset on large pages.  Just don't try when folio_test_large().
