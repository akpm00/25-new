Subject: kfence: allow re-enabling KFENCE after system startup

Patch series "provide the flexibility to enable KFENCE", v3.

If CONFIG_CONTIG_ALLOC is not supported, we fallback to try
alloc_pages_exact().  Allocating pages in this way has limits about
MAX_ORDER (default 11).  So we will not support allocating kfence pool
after system startup with a large KFENCE_NUM_OBJECTS.

When handling failures in kfence_init_pool_late(), we pair
free_pages_exact() to alloc_pages_exact() for compatibility consideration,
though it actually does the same as free_contig_range().


This patch (of 2):

If once KFENCE is disabled by:
echo 0 > /sys/module/kfence/parameters/sample_interval
KFENCE could never be re-enabled until next rebooting.

Allow re-enabling it by writing a positive num to sample_interval.
