Subject: mm: submit multipage reads for SWP_FS_OPS swap-space

swap_readpage() is given one page at a time, but may be called repeatedly
in succession.

For block-device swap-space, the blk_plug functionality allows the
multiple pages to be combined together at lower layers.  That cannot be
used for SWP_FS_OPS as blk_plug may not exist - it is only active when
CONFIG_BLOCK=y.  Consequently all swap reads over NFS are single page
reads.

With this patch we pass in a pointer-to-pointer when swap_readpage can
store state between calls - much like the effect of blk_plug.  After
calling swap_readpage() some number of times, the state will be passed to
swap_read_unplug() which can submit the combined request.
