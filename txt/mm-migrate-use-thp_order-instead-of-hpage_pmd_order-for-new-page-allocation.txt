Subject: mm: migrate: use thp_order instead of HPAGE_PMD_ORDER for new page allocation.

Fix a VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO(folio_nr_pages(old) != nr_pages) crash.

With folios support, it is possible to have other than HPAGE_PMD_ORDER
THPs, in the form of folios, in the system.  Use thp_order() to correctly
determine the source page order during migration.
