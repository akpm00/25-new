Subject: mm: perform async writes to SWP_FS_OPS swap-space using ->swap_rw

This patch switches swap-out to SWP_FS_OPS swap-spaces to use ->swap_rw
and makes the writes asynchronous, like they are for other swap spaces.

To make it async we need to allocate the kiocb struct from a mempool. 
This may block, but won't block as long as waiting for the write to
complete.  At most it will wait for some previous swap IO to complete.
