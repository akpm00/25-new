Subject: tools/vm/page_owner_sort.c: support for selecting by PID, TGID or task command name

When viewing page owner information, we may also need to select the blocks
by PID, TGID or task command name, which helps to get more accurate page
allocation information as needed.

Therefore, following adjustments are made:

1. Add three new options, including --pid, --tgid and --name, to support
the selection of information blocks by a specific pid, tgid and task
command name. In addtion, multiple options are allowed to be used at the
same time.

	./page_owner_sort [input] [output] --pid <PID>
	./page_owner_sort [input] [output] --tgid <TGID>
	./page_owner_sort [input] [output] --name <TASK_COMMAND_NAME>

Assuming a scenario when a multi-threaded program, ./demo (PID = 5280),
is running, and ./demo creates a child process (PID = 5281).

	$ps
	PID   TTY        TIME   CMD
	5215  pts/0    00:00:00  bash
	5280  pts/0    00:00:00  ./demo
	5281  pts/0    00:00:00  ./demo
	5282  pts/0    00:00:00  ps

It would be better to filter out the records with tgid=5280 and the
task name "demo" when debugging the parent process, and the specific
usage is

	./page_owner_sort [input] [output] --tgid 5280 --name demo

2. Add explanations of three new options, including --pid, --tgid
and --name, to the document.
