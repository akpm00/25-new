Subject: mm/early_ioremap: declare early_memremap_pgprot_adjust()

The mm/ directory can almost fully be built with W=1, which would help in
local development.  One remaining issue is missing prototype for
early_memremap_pgprot_adjust().

Thus add a declaration for this function.  Use mm/internal.h instead of
asm/early_ioremap.h to avoid missing type definitions and unnecessary
exposure.
