Subject: mm/vmscan: make sure wakeup_kswapd with managed zone

wakeup_kswapd() only wake up kswapd when the zone is managed.

For two callers of wakeup_kswapd(), they are node perspective.

  * wake_all_kswapds
  * numamigrate_isolate_page

If we picked up a !managed zone, this is not we expected.

This patch makes sure we pick up a managed zone for wakeup_kswapd().  And
it also use managed_zone in migrate_balanced_pgdat() to get the proper
zone.
