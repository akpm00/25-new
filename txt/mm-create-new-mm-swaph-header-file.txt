Subject: mm: create new mm/swap.h header file.

Patch series "MM changes to improve swap-over-NFS support".

Assorted improvements for swap-via-filesystem.

This is a resend of these patches, rebased on current HEAD.  The only
substantial changes is that swap_dirty_folio has replaced
swap_set_page_dirty.

Currently swap-via-fs (SWP_FS_OPS) doesn't work for any filesystem.  It
has previously worked for NFS but that broke a few releases back.  This
series changes to use a new ->swap_rw rather than ->readpage and
->direct_IO.  It also makes other improvements.

There is a companion series already in linux-next which fixes various
issues with NFS.  Once both series land, a final patch is needed which
changes NFS over to use ->swap_rw.


This patch (of 10):

Many functions declared in include/linux/swap.h are only used within mm/

Create a new "mm/swap.h" and move some of these declarations there.
Remove the redundant 'extern' from the function declarations.
