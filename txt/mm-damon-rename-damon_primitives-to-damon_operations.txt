Subject: mm/damon: rename damon_primitives to damon_operations

Patch series "Allow DAMON user code independent of monitoring primitives".

In-kernel DAMON user code is required to configure the monitoring context
(struct damon_ctx) with proper monitoring primitives (struct
damon_primitive).  This makes the user code dependent to all supporting
monitoring primitives.  For example, DAMON debugfs interface depends on
both DAMON_VADDR and DAMON_PADDR, though some users have interest in only
one use case.  As more monitoring primitives are introduced, the problem
will be bigger.

To minimize such unnecessary dependency, this patchset makes monitoring
primitives can be registered by the implemnting code and later dynamically
searched and selected by the user code.

In addition to that, this patchset renames monitoring primitives to
monitoring operations, which is more easy to intuitively understand what
it means and how it would be structed.


This patch (of 8):

DAMON has a set of callback functions called monitoring primitives and let
it can be configured with various implementations for easy extension for
different address spaces and usages.  However, the word 'primitive' is not
so explicit.  Meanwhile, many other structs resembles similar purpose
calls themselves 'operations'.  To make the code easier to be understood,
this commit renames 'damon_primitives' to 'damon_operations' before it is
too late to rename.
