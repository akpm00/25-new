Subject: mm: rmap: move the cache flushing to the correct place for hugetlb PMD sharing

The cache level flush will always be first when changing an existing
virtual–>physical mapping to a new value, since this allows us to
properly handle systems whose caches are strict and require a
virtual–>physical translation to exist for a virtual address.  So we
should move the cache flushing before huge_pmd_unshare().

As Muchun pointed out[1], now the architectures whose supporting hugetlb
PMD sharing have no cache flush issues in practice.  But I think we should
still follow the cache/TLB flushing rules when changing a valid virtual
address mapping in case of potential issues in future.
