Subject: kasan: respect KASAN_BIT_REPORTED in all reporting routines

Currently, only kasan_report() checks the KASAN_BIT_REPORTED and
KASAN_BIT_MULTI_SHOT flags.

Make other reporting routines check these flags as well.

Also add explanatory comments.

Note that the current->kasan_depth check is split out into
report_suppressed() and only called for kasan_report().
