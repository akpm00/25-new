Subject: mm/memory-failure.c: dissolve truncated hugetlb page

If me_huge_page meets a truncated huge page, hpage won't be dissolved even
if we hold the last refcnt.  It's because the truncated huge page has NULL
page_mapping while it's not anonymous page too.  Thus we lose the last
chance to dissolve it into buddy to save healthy subpages.  Remove
PageAnon check to handle these huge pages too.
