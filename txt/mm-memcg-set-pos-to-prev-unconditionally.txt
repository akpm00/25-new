Subject: mm/memcg: set pos to prev unconditionally

Current code sets pos to prev based on condition (prev && !reclaim), while
we can do this unconditionally.

Since:

  * If !reclaim, pos is the same as prev no matter it is NULL or not.
  * If reclaim, pos would be set properly from iter->position.
