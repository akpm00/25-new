Subject: mm/shmem: handle uffd-wp during fork()

Normally we skip copy page when fork() for VM_SHARED shmem, but we can't
skip it anymore if uffd-wp is enabled on dst vma.  This should only happen
when the src uffd has UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_FORK enabled on uffd-wp shmem
vma, so that VM_UFFD_WP will be propagated onto dst vma too, then we
should copy the pgtables with uffd-wp bit and pte markers, because these
information will be lost otherwise.

Since the condition checks will become even more complicated for deciding
"whether a vma needs to copy the pgtable during fork()", introduce a
helper vma_needs_copy() for it, so everything will be clearer.
