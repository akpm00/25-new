Subject: kselftests: memcg: update the oom group leaf events test

Patch series "mm: memcg kselftests fixes".


This patch (of 4):

Commit 9852ae3fe529 ("mm, memcg: consider subtrees in memory.events") made
memory.events recursive: all events are propagated upwards by the tree. 
It was a change in semantics.

It broke the oom group leaf events test: it assumes that after an OOM the
oom_kill counter is zero on parent's level.

Let's adjust the test: it should have similar expectations for the child
and parent levels.

The test passes after this fix.
