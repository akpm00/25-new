Fix for CONFIG_SLOB builds:

>> mm/memcontrol.c:7467:6: error: redefinition of 'obj_cgroup_may_zswap'
   bool obj_cgroup_may_zswap(struct obj_cgroup *objcg)
	^
   include/linux/memcontrol.h:1816:20: note: previous definition is here
   static inline bool obj_cgroup_may_zswap(struct obj_cgroup *objcg)

The header file uses CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM && CONFIG_ZSWAP to decide on
implementation vs dummies; the .c file uses CONFIG_ZSWAP.  SLOB builds
don't have CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM (for historical reasons).

Gate everything in the code file on CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM as well for now. 
Eventually, CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM should be removed and folded into
CONFIG_MEMCG.
