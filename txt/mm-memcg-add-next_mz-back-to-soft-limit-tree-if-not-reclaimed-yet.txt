Subject: mm/memcg: add next_mz back to soft limit tree if not reclaimed yet

When memory reclaim failed for a maximum number of attempts and we bail
out of the reclaim loop, we forgot to put the target mem_cgroup chosen for
next reclaim back to the soft limit tree.  This prevented pages in the
mem_cgroup from being reclaimed in the future even though the mem_cgroup
exceeded its soft limit.

Let's say there are two mem_cgroup and both of them exceed the soft limit,
while the first one is more active then the second.  Since we add a
mem_cgroup to soft limit tree every 1024 event, the second one just get a
rare chance to be put on soft limit tree even it exceeds the limit.

As time goes on, the first mem_cgroup was kept close to its soft limit due
to reclaim activities, while the memory usage of the second mem_cgroup
keeps growing over the soft limit for a long time due to its relatively
rare occurrence.

This patch adds next_mz back to prevent this scenario.
