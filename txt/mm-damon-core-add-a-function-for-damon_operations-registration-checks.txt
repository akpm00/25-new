Subject: mm/damon/core: add a function for damon_operations registration checks

Patch series "mm/damon: allow users know which monitoring ops are available".

DAMON users can configure it for vaious address spaces including virtual
address spaces and the physical address space by setting its monitoring
operations set with appropriate one for their purpose.  However, there is
no celan and simple way to know exactly which monitoring operations sets
are available on the currently running kernel.

This patchset adds functions for the purpose on DAMON's kernel API
('damon_is_registered_ops()') and sysfs interface ('avail_operations' file
under each context directory).


This patch (of 4):

To know if a specific 'damon_operations' is registered, users need to
check the kernel config or try 'damon_select_ops()' with the ops of the
question, and then see if it successes.  In the latter case, the user
should also revert the change.  To make the process simple and convenient,
this commit adds a function for checking if a specific 'damon_operations'
is registered or not.
