Subject: kernel/resource: fix kfree() of bootmem memory again

Since commit ebff7d8f270d ("mem hotunplug: fix kfree() of bootmem
memory"), we could get a resource allocated during boot via
alloc_resource().  And it's required to release the resource using
free_resource().  Howerver, many people use kfree directly which will
result in kernel BUG.  In order to fix this without fixing every call
site, just leak a couple of bytes in such corner case.
