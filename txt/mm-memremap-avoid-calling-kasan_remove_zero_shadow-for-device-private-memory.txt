Subject: mm/memremap: avoid calling kasan_remove_zero_shadow() for device private memory

For device private memory, we do not create a linear mapping for the
memory because the device memory is un-accessible.  Thus we do not add
kasan zero shadow for it.  So it's unnecessary to do
kasan_remove_zero_shadow() for it.
