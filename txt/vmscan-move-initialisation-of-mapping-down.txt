Subject: vmscan: move initialisation of mapping down

Now that we don't interrogate the BDI for congestion, we can delay looking
up the folio's mapping until we've got further through the function,
reducing register pressure and saving a call to folio_mapping for folios
we're adding to the swap cache.
