Subject: mm: teach core mm about pte markers

This patch still does not use pte marker in any way, however it teaches
the core mm about the pte marker idea.

For example, handle_pte_marker() is introduced that will parse and handle
all the pte marker faults.

Many of the places are more about commenting it up - so that we know
there's the possibility of pte marker showing up, and why we don't need
special code for the cases.
