Subject: mm/memory-failure.c: fix race with changing page compound again

Patch series "A few fixup patches for memory failure", v2.

This series contains a few patches to fix the race with changing page
compound page, make non-LRU movable pages unhandlable and so on.  More
details can be found in the respective changelogs.


There is a race window where we got the compound_head, the hugetlb page
could be freed to buddy, or even changed to another compound page just
before we try to get hwpoison page.  Think about the below race window:

  CPU 1					  CPU 2
  memory_failure_hugetlb
  struct page *head = compound_head(p);
					  hugetlb page might be freed to
					  buddy, or even changed to another
					  compound page.

  get_hwpoison_page -- page is not what we want now...

If this race happens, just bail out.  Also MF_MSG_DIFFERENT_PAGE_SIZE is
introduced to record this event.
