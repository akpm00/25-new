Subject: mm, memory_hotplug: reorganize new pgdat initialization

When a !node_online node is brought up it needs a hotplug specific
initialization because the node could be either uninitialized yet or it
could have been recycled after previous hotremove.  hotadd_init_pgdat is
responsible for that.

Internal pgdat state is initialized at two places currently
	- hotadd_init_pgdat
	- free_area_init_core_hotplug

There is no real clear cut what should go where but this patch's chosen to
move the whole internal state initialization into
free_area_init_core_hotplug.  hotadd_init_pgdat is still responsible to
pull all the parts together - most notably to initialize zonelists because
those depend on the overall topology.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional change.
