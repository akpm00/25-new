Subject: kasan: fix hw tags enablement when KUNIT tests are disabled

Kasan enables hw tags via kasan_enable_tagging() which based on the mode
passed via kernel command line selects the correct hw backend. 
kasan_enable_tagging() is meant to be invoked indirectly via the cpu
features framework of the architectures that support these backends. 
Currently the invocation of this function is guarded by
CONFIG_KASAN_KUNIT_TEST which allows the enablement of the correct backend
only when KUNIT tests are enabled in the kernel.

This inconsistency was introduced in commit:

  ed6d74446cbf ("kasan: test: support async (again) and asymm modes for HW_TAGS")

... and prevents to enable MTE on arm64 when KUNIT tests for kasan hw_tags are
disabled.

Fix the issue making sure that the CONFIG_KASAN_KUNIT_TEST guard does not
prevent the correct invocation of kasan_enable_tagging().
